<div><h1 class='nobreak'><a id='pow'></a>THE CROWNING OF POWHATAN.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> settlement at Jamestown was begun in 1606.
Among the earliest of the adventurers was the
chivalrous Captain Smith, whose life was a romance
even in those romantic days. He soon came to be
the leader of the colonists, and it was through his
exertions that the settlement was kept up, amid privations
and dangers almost incredible. The story
of his capture by the Indians, and his preservation
from death by Pocahontas, has become a national
tradition, and poets have sung, orators declaimed,
and novelists penned volumes to record the bravery
of the Captain, and the love of the Indian maid. But,
perhaps, nowhere is the story told with such effect
as in the “Generall Historie” of the gallant Smith
himself, a work published in 1624, and still to be met
with in the libraries of the curious. The book is a
rarity. It is adorned with maps,—not the most
correct, to be sure—and with engravings setting
forth the various perilous situations of the author,
over which a book-worm would gloat for a month.
The narrative is written in a plain, frank, unassuming
style, and the author is always spoken of in
the third person. To this book we are indebted for
an account of the crowning of Powhatan, and our
only regret is that our limits will not suffer us to
give the quaint language of Smith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This singular ceremony took place in 1608, and
was performed at the instigation of the council at
home, who sent over the necessary insignia by Capt.
Newport from London. The object of the ceremony
was to propitiate Powhatan, and induce him to guide
the colonists to the country of the <span class='it'>Monacons</span>, whom
the dreamy adventurers, exaggerating the casual
hints of the Indians, had pictured to themselves as
a people of boundless wealth. It is evident, from
the “Generall Historie,” that Smith did not approve
of the measure, for he says appositely—“As for the
coronation of Powhatan, and his presents of Basin
and Ewer, Bed, Bedstead, Clothes, &amp;c., and such
costly novelties, they had been much better spared
than so ill spent, for we had his favor much better
only for a plain piece of copper.” The measure had
been resolved on at home, however, and Captain
Smith had no alternative but to obey. Accordingly,
he sent a messenger to Powhatan to come and receive
his presents; but the Indian monarch, with the
spirit of an Alexander, replied, “If your King have
sent me presents, I also am a King, and this is my
land: eight days I will stay to receive them. Your
father is to come to me, not I to him.” The Captain
now sent the presents “a hundred miles by river,”
as he tells us, to Powhatan. Here a masked ball
and other festivities came off, in which the Captain
seems to have been quite a favorite with the Indian
belles. At length the ceremony of the coronation
was performed, but, if the bold Captain speaks aright,
it must have been a sorry crowning. He says,
“But a sore trouble there was to make him kneel
to receive his crown, he neither knowing the majesty
nor meaning of a crown, nor bending of the knee,
endured as many persuasions, examples and instructions
as enraged them all. At last, <span class='it'>by bearing hard
on his shoulders</span>, he a little stooped, and those having
the crown in their hands put it on his head, when by
the warning of a pistol, the boats were prepared
with such a volley of shot, that the King started up
with a horrible fear, till he saw all was well.” A
graphic picture. A sturdy old republican was Powhatan,
having no notion of their crown! We imagine
we can see the perturbation of the good Captain
and his followers when they found that the old
warrior would not kneel, and the glee with which
they regarded their success, when, by pressing hard
on the royal shoulders, they surprised him into being
duly crowned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The honor, however, failed of its object. Powhatan
would give no aid to the colonists in their designs
on the Monacons, although that people was a
sworn enemy to his race. He proudly said that he
needed no ally—that he could conquer his foes alone.
The only return he made for the gifts of the council
was a present of an old pair of slippers and a mantle
to Capt. Newport. The picture, by Chapman, graphically
pourtrays the ceremony.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>HEINRICH HEINE.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY HENRY W. LONGFELLOW.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Ludwig Börne</span>, the well-known author of <span class='it'>Letters
from Paris</span>, once said, that Voltaire was only the
John the Baptist of Antichrist, but that Heine was
Antichrist himself. Perhaps he paid Heine too great
a compliment yet the remark is true so far as this,
that it points him out as the leader of that new school
in Germany which is seeking to establish a religion
of sensuality, and to build a palace of Pleasure on
the ruins of the church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This school is known under the name of Young
Germany. It is skeptical, and sensual; and seems
desirous of trying again the experiment so often tried
before, but never with any success, of living without
a God. Heine expresses this in phrases too blasphemous
or too voluptuous to repeat; and Gutzkow, his
follower exclaims: “Let the only Priest, that weds
our hearts, be a moment of rapture, not the church,
with her ceremonies, and her servants with parted
hair;” and again with a sigh: “Alas! had the world
known nothing of God, it would have been happier!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus the old and oft-repeated follies of mankind
come up and are lived over again by young men,
who despise the wisdom of the Past, and imagine
themselves wiser than their own generation. Nor
are these young men without their admirers and advocates.
Madame Dacier, of classic memory, defended
Sappho’s morals, and in reply to the hereditary
scandal against her, coldly said: “Sappho had her
enemies.” Nearly in the same way is Young Germany
defended; and even theologians have not been
wanting, to palliate, excuse and justify.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this country, there are certain persons, who
seem disposed to enact this same tragic farce; for
we too, have our Young America, which mocks the
elder prophets, and cries “Go up, bald-head!”—Young
ladies read with delight such books as <span class='it'>Festus</span>,
and think the <span class='it'>Elective Affinities</span> “religious almost to
piety.” Young men, who profess to be Christians,
like the Pagan of Lafontaine, believe in God by a
kind of patent-right,—<span class='it'>par bénéfice d’inventaire</span>. Nature,
we are told, must not be interfered with in any
way, at any time; and so much is said about this, that
many respectable people begin to say with old Voss,
“Dear Nature! thou seemest to me quite too natural!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not, however, propose to discuss these points
in the following sketch; nor to consider Heine’s
plans for regenerating society, which, at best, are
but vague opinions thrown out recklessly and at random,
like fire-brands, that set in a flame whatever
light matter they fall upon. It is the Author only,
that I shall attempt to sketch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry Heine was born in 1797 at Düsseldorf on the
Rhine; and studied at the Universities of Bonn, Berlin,
and Göttingen. He afterwards resided in Hamburg,
Berlin and Munich; and since 1830 has lived
in Paris. His principal writings are <span class='it'>Buch der Lieder</span>,
a collection of lyrical poems; two tragedies, <span class='it'>Almansor</span>
and <span class='it'>Radcliff</span>; the four volumes of <span class='it'>Reisebilder</span>;
the <span class='it'>Beiträge zur Geschichte der neuern schönen Literatur
in Deutschland</span>; the <span class='it'>Frangësische Zustände</span>;
and <span class='it'>Der Salon</span>,—the last two being collections of his
various contributions to the German newspapers.
The most popular of his writings is the <span class='it'>Reisebilder</span>,
(Pictures of Travel.) The <span class='it'>Beiträge</span> has been translated
into English, by Geo. W. Haven, under the title
of <span class='it'>Letters auxiliary to the History of modern Polite
Literature in Germany, Boston, 1836</span>. The same
work, with many additions, has been published in
Paris, under the title of <span class='it'>De l’Allemagne</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The style of Heine is remarkable for vigor, wit and
brilliancy; but is wanting in taste and refinement.
To the recklessness of Byron he adds the sentimentality
of Sterne. The <span class='it'>Reisebilder</span> is a kind of <span class='it'>Don
Juan</span> in prose, with passages from the <span class='it'>Sentimental
Journey</span>. He is always in extremes, either of
praise or censure; setting at nought the decencies
of life, and treating the most sacred things with
frivolity. Throughout his writings you see traces
of a morbid, ill-regulated mind; of deep feeling, disappointment
and suffering. His sympathies seem to
have died within him, like Ugolino’s children in the
tower of Famine. With all his various powers, he
wants the one great power—the power of truth! He
wants, too, that ennobling principle of all human
endeavors, the aspiration “after an ideal standard,
that is higher than himself.” In a word, he wants sincerity
and spirituality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the highest degree reprehensible, too, is the
fierce, implacable hatred with which Heine pursues
his foes. No man should write of another as he permits
himself to do at times. In speaking of Schlegel,
as he does in his <span class='it'>German Literature</span>, he is utterly
without apology. And yet to such remorseless invectives,
to such witty sarcasms, he is indebted in a
great degree for his popularity. It was not till after
he had bitten the heel of Hercules, that the Crab was
placed among the constellations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following passages from the <span class='it'>Reisebilder</span>, will
give the reader a general idea of Heine’s style; exhibiting
at once his beauties and defects—his poetic
feeling—his spirit—his wit—his want of taste. The
first is from his description of a <span class='it'>Tour to the Harz
Mountains</span>; the second from his <span class='it'>Journey from Munich
to Genoa</span>.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SCENE ON THE BROCKEN.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>In the dining-room of the inn I found all life and
motion; students from various Universities; some
just arrived, are refreshing themselves, others are
preparing for their departure, buckling their knapsacks,
writing their names in the Album, receiving
<span class='it'>Brocken-bouquets</span> from the servant girl; there is
pinching of cheeks, singing, dancing, shouting; questions
are asked, answers given,—fine weather,—footpath,—God
bless you—good bye. Some of the
departing are a little jolly, and take double delight in
the beautiful view, because a man when he is drunk
sees all things double.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I had somewhat refreshed myself, I ascended
the observatory, and found there a little gentleman
with two ladies, one of them young, the other
oldish. The young lady was very beautiful. A glorious
figure,—upon her curling tresses a helm-like
hat of black satin, with whose white feathers the
wind sported;—her delicate limbs so closely wrapped
in a black silk mantle, that the noble outlines
were distinctly seen;—and her free, large eye quietly
gazing forth into the free, large world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I sought without more ado to engage the beautiful
lady in conversation; for one does not truly enjoy
the beauties of Nature, unless he can express his
feelings at the moment. She was not intellectual,
but attentive, sensible. Of a truth, most aristocratic
features. I do not mean that common, stiff, negative
aristocratic bearing, that knows exactly what
must be let alone; but that rare, free, positive aristocratic
bearing, which tells us clearly what we may
do, and gives us with the greatest freedom of manners,
the greatest social security. To my own astonishment,
I displayed considerable geographical
knowledge; told the curious fair one all the names
of the towns that lay before us; found and showed
her the same on my map, which I unfolded with
true professional dignity, upon the stone table in the
middle of the platform. Many of the towns I could
not find, perhaps because I looked for them rather
with my fingers, than with my eyes, which meanwhile
were investigating the face of the gentle lady,
and found more beautiful excursions there than
<span class='it'>Schierke</span> and <span class='it'>Elend</span>. It was one of those faces that
never excite, seldom fascinate, and always please.
I love such faces, because they smile to sleep my
turbulent heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In what relation the little gentleman, who accompanied
the ladies, stood to them I could not guess.
He was a thin, curious-looking figure; a little head,
sparingly covered with little grey hairs, that came
down over his narrow forehead as far as his green
dragon-fly eyes, his crooked nose projecting to a
great length, and his mouth and chin retreating
anxiously towards the ears. This funny little face
seemed to be made of a soft, yellowish clay, such as
sculptors use in forming their first models, and when
the thin lips were pressed together, a thousand
fine, semi-circular wrinkles covered his cheeks.
Not one word did the little gentleman say; and only
now and then, when the elderly lady whispered
something pleasant in his ear, he smiled like a poodle-dog
with a cold in his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The elderly lady was the mother of the younger,
and likewise possessed the most aristocratic form
and feature. Her eye betrayed a morbid, sentimental
melancholy; about her mouth was an expression of
rigid piety; and yet it seemed to me, as if once it had
been very beautiful, had laughed much, and taken
and given many a kiss. Her face resembled a <span class='it'>Codex
palympsestus</span>, where, beneath the recent, black,
monkish copy of a homily of one of the Fathers of
the Church, peeped forth the half effaced verses of
some ancient Greek love-poet. Both of the ladies,
with their companion, had been that year in Italy,
and told me all kinds of pretty things about Rome,
Florence and Venice. The mother had a great deal
to say of Raphael’s paintings at St. Peter’s; the
daughter talked more about the opera and the <span class='it'>Teatro
Fenice</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While we were speaking it began to grow dark;
the air grew colder, the sun sank lower, and the
platform was filled with students, mechanics, and
some respectable cockneys, with their wives and
daughters, all of whom had come to see the sun set.
It is a sublime spectacle, which attunes the soul to
prayer. A full quarter of an hour stood we all
solemnly silent, and saw how that beauteous ball of
fire by slow degrees sank in the west; our faces
were lighted by the ruddy glow of evening,—our
hands folded themselves involuntarily;—it was as if
we stood there, a silent congregation in the nave of
a vast cathedral, and the Priest were elevating the
Body of the Lord, and the eternal choral of Palestrina
flowing down from the organ!</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I stood thus absorbed in devotion, I heard some
one say close beside me,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Generally speaking, how very beautiful nature
is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These words came from the tender heart of my
fellow lodger, the young shop-keeper. They brought
me back again to my work-day mood, and I was just
in the humor to say several very polite things to the
ladies about the sunset, and quietly conduct them
back to their room, as if nothing had happened.
They permitted me to sit and talk with them another
hour. As the earth itself, so revolved our conversation
round the sun. The mother remarked, that the
sun, sinking in vapors, had looked like a red, blushing
rose, which the Heaven in its gallantry had
thrown down upon the broad-spreading, white bridal
veil of his beloved Earth! The daughter smiled, and
expressed herself of the opinion, that too great familiarity
with the appearances of nature weakened
their effect. The mother corrected this erroneous
view by a passage from Göthe’s <span class='it'>Reisebriefen</span>, and
asked me if I had read the <span class='it'>Sorrows of Werther</span>. I
believe we talked also about Angola cats, Etruscan
vases, Cashmire shawls, macaroni and Lord Byron,
from whose poems the elderly lady, prettily lisping
and sighing, recited some passages on sunsets. To
the younger lady, who did not understand English,
but wanted to read Byron, I recommended the
translations of my fair and gifted country-woman,
the Baronese Elise von Hohenhausen; and availed
myself of the opportunity, as I always do with young
ladies, to express myself with warmth upon Byron’s
ungodliness, unloveliness and unhappiness.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>STREET MUSICIANS.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>When I returned to the <span class='it'>Locanda della Grande
Europa</span>, when I had ordered a good <span class='it'>Pranzo</span>, I was
so sad at heart that I could not eat,—and that means
a great deal. I seated myself before the door of the
neighboring <span class='it'>Botega</span>, refreshed myself with an ice,
and said within myself:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Capricious Heart! thou art now forsooth in Italy—why
singest thou not like the lark? Perhaps the
old German Sorrows, the little serpents, that hid
themselves deep within thee have come with us into
Italy, and are making merry now, and their common
jubilee awakens in my breast that picturesque
sorrow, which so strangely stings and dances and
whistles? And why should not the old sorrows
make merry for once? Here in Italy it is indeed so
beautiful, suffering itself is here so beautiful,—in
these ruinous marble palaces sighs sound far more
romantically, than in our neat brick houses,—beneath
yon laurel trees one can weep far more
voluptuously, than under our surly, jagged pines,—and
gaze with looks of far sweeter longing at the
ideal cloud-landscapes of celestial Italy, than at the
ash-gray, German work-day heaven, where the very
clouds wear the looks of decent burghers, and yawn
so tediously down upon us! Stay then in my heart,
ye sorrows! Nowhere will you find a better lodging.
You are dear and precious to me; and no man
knows better how to father and cherish you, than I;
and I confess to you, you give me pleasure. And
after all, what is pleasure? Pleasure is nothing else
than a highly agreeable Pain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I believe that the music, which, without my taking
note of it, sounded before the <span class='it'>Botega</span>, and had
already drawn round itself a circle of spectators, had
melo-dramatically accompanied this monologue. It
was a strange trio, consisting of two men, and a
young girl, who played the harp. One of the men,
warmly clad in a white shaggy coat, was a robust
fellow, with a dark-red bandit-face, that gleamed
from his black hair and beard, like a portentous
comet; and between his legs he held a monstrous
bass-viol, upon which he sawed as furiously, as if he
had thrown down a poor traveller in the Abruzzi,
and was in haste to fiddle his windpipe in two. The
other was a tall, meagre graybeard, whose mouldering
bones shook in their thread-bare, black garments,
and whose snow-white hair formed a lamentable
contrast with his <span class='it'>buffo</span> song and his foolish capers.
It is sad enough, when an old man must barter for
bread the respect we owe to his years, and give
himself up to buffoonery; but more melancholy still,
when he does this before or with his own child! For
that girl was the daughter of the old <span class='it'>Buffo</span>, and accompanied
with the harp the lowest jests of her
gray-headed father; or, laying her harp aside sang
with him a comic duet, in which he represented an
amorous old dotard and she the young coquettish
<span class='it'>inamorata</span>. Moreover the girl seemed hardly to
have passed the threshold of childhood; as if the
child, before it had grown to maidenhood, had been
made a woman, and not an honest woman. Hence
that pallid, faded look, and the expression of nervous
discontent in her beautiful face, whose proudly
rounded features as it were disdained all show of
compassion;—hence the secret sorrowfulness of the
eyes, that from beneath their black, triumphal arches
flashed forth such challenges;—hence the deep
mournful voice, that so strangely contrasted with
the laughing, beautiful lips, from which it fell;—hence
the debility of those too delicate limbs, around
which a short, anxious-looking robe of violet-colored
silk, fluttered as low as it possibly could. In addition
to this, gay, variegated satin ribbands flaunted
from her faded straw hat, and emblematic of herself,
her breast was adorned with an open rose-bud,
which seemed rather to have been rudely torn open,
than to have bloomed forth from its green sheath by
its own natural growth. Still in this unhappy girl,
in this Spring which Death had already breathed
upon and blasted,—lay an indescribable charm, a
grace, which revealed itself in every look, in every
motion, in every tone. The bolder her gestures became,
the deeper grew my compassion; and when
her voice rose from her breast so weak and wondrous,
and as it were implored forgiveness; then
triumphed in my breast the little serpents, and bit
their tails for joy. The Rose likewise seemed to
look at me imploringly; once I saw it tremble and
grow pale,—but at the same moment rose the trills
of the girl so much the more laughingly aloft, the old
man wooed still more amorously, and the red comet-face
murdered his viol so grimly, that it uttered the
most terrifically droll sounds, and the spectators
shouted more madly than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little harper must have remarked, that while
she was singing and playing, I looked often at the
rose upon her breast; and as I afterwards threw
upon the tin plate, with which she collected her
honorarium, a piece of gold, and not of the smallest,
she smiled slily, and asked me secretly, if I wanted
her rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Think no evil, dear reader. It had grown dark,
and the stars looked so pure and pious down into my
heart. In that heart itself, however, trembled the
memory of the dead Maria. I thought again of that
night, when I stood beside the bed, where lay her
beautiful, pale form, with soft, still lips—I thought
again of the strange look the old woman cast at me,
who was to watch by the dead body, and surrendered
her charge to me for a few hours—I thought again
of the night-violet, that stood in a glass upon the
table, and smelt so strangely. Again I shuddered
with the doubt, whether it were really a draft of
wind, that blew the lamp out?—or whether there
were a third person in the chamber!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The minor poems of Heine, like most of his prose
writings, are but a portrait of himself. The same
melancholy tone,—the same endless sigh,—pervades
them. Though they possess the highest lyric merit
they are for the most part fragmentary;—expressions
of some momentary state of feeling,—sudden ejaculations
of pain or pleasure, of restlessness, impatience,
regret, longing, love. They profess to be
songs, and as songs must they be judged, and as
German Songs. Then these imperfect expressions
of feeling,—these mere suggestions of thought,—this
“luminous mist,” that half reveals, half hides the
sense,—this selection of topics from scenes of every
day life, and in fine this prevailing tone of sentimental
sadness, will not seem affected, misplaced
nor exaggerated. At the same time it must be confessed
that the trivial and common-place recur too
frequently in these songs. Here, likewise, as in the
prose of Heine, the lofty aim is wanting; we listen
in vain for the spirit-stirring note—for the word of
power—for those ancestral melodies, which, amid
the uproar of the world, breathe in our ears forever-more
the voices of consolation, encouragement and
warning. Heine is not sufficiently in earnest to be a
great poet.</p>

<p class='line0'>The landscape smiles upon the sight!</p>
<p class='line0'>Here, the deep golden wheat-fields vie</p>
<p class='line0'>With the rich carpets of the rye,</p>
<p class='line0'>The buckwheat’s snowy mantles, there,</p>

<p class='line0'>The yellow melon, underneath,</p>
<p class='line0'>Plump, ripening, in its viny wreath:</p>
<p class='line0'>Here, the thick rows of new-mown grass,</p>

<p class='line0'>From the rough saw-mill, where hath rung</p>
<p class='line0'>Through all the hours, its grating tongue,</p>
<p class='line0'>The raftsman sallies, as the gray</p>
<p class='line0'>Of evening tells the flight of day:</p>

<p class='line0'>His cabin by the river-side.</p>
<p class='line0'>As twilight darkens into night,</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Hurl’d by the flood’s tremendous might,</p>
<p class='line0'>Piles the opposing precipice,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And every fragment swells the height;</p>
<p class='line0'>Hour after hour uprears the wall,</p>

<p class='line0'>Breasts the wild waves that vain upswell</p>
<p class='line0'>To overwhelm the obstacle:</p>
<p class='line0'>They bathe the alder on the verge,</p>
<p class='line0'>The leaning hemlock now they merge,</p>
<p class='line0'>The stately elm is dwindling low</p>
<p class='line0'>Within the deep engulfing flow,</p>
<p class='line0'>Till curb’d thus in its headlong flight,</p>
<p class='line0'>With its accumulated might,</p>
<p class='line0'>The river turning on its track,</p>

<p class='line0'>And now his sawmill’s jarring rings;</p>
<p class='line0'>Now his huge raft is shooting swift</p>
<p class='line0'>Cochecton’s white tumultuous rift,</p>
<p class='line0'>Now floats it on the ebon lap</p>
<p class='line0'>Of the grim shadow’d Water Gap,</p>
<p class='line0'>And now it’s tossing on the swells</p>
<p class='line0'>Fierce dashing down the slope of Wells,</p>
<p class='line0'>The rapids crash upon his ear,</p>
<p class='line0'>The deep sounds roll more loud and near,</p>
<p class='line0'>They fill his dream—he starts—he wakes!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The moonlight through the casement falls,</p>
<p class='line0'>Ha! the wild sight that on him breaks,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The floods sweep round his cabin-walls,</p>
<p class='line0'>Beneath their bounding thundering shocks,</p>
<p class='line0'>The frail log fabric groans and rocks;</p>
<p class='line0'>Crash, crash! the ice-bolts round it shiver,</p>
<p class='line0'>The walls like blast-swept branches quiver,</p>
<p class='line0'>His wife is clinging to his breast,</p>
<p class='line0'>The child within his arms is prest,</p>
<p class='line0'>He staggers through the chilly flood</p>
<p class='line0'>That numbs his limbs, and checks his blood,</p>
<p class='line0'>On, on, he strives—the waters lave</p>
<p class='line0'>Higher his form with every wave,</p>
<p class='line0'>They steep his breast, on each side dash</p>
<p class='line0'>The splinter’d ice with thundering crash</p>
<p class='line0'>A fragment strikes him—ha! he reels,</p>
<p class='line0'>That shock in every nerve he feels,</p>
<p class='line0'>Faster, bold raftsman, speed thy way,</p>
<p class='line0'>The waves roar round thee for their prey,</p>
<p class='line0'>Thy cabin totters—sinks—the flood</p>
<p class='line0'>Rolls its mad surges where it stood:</p>
<p class='line0'>Before thy straining sight, the hill</p>
<p class='line0'>Sleeps in the moonlight, bright and still,</p>
<p class='line0'>Falter not, falter not, struggle on,</p>
<p class='line0'>That goal of safety may be won,</p>
<p class='line0'>Heavily droops thy wife with fear,</p>
<p class='line0'>Thy boy’s shrill shriekings fill thine ear;</p>
<p class='line0'>Urge, urge thy strength to where out-fling</p>
<p class='line0'>Yon cedar branches for thy cling.</p>
<p class='line0'>Joy, raftsman joy! thy need is past,</p>
<p class='line0'>The wish’d for goal is won at last,</p>
<p class='line0'>Joy, raftsman joy! thy quick foot now</p>
<p class='line0'>Is resting on the hill’s steep brow:</p>
<p class='line0'>Praise to high heaven, each knee is bending,</p>
<p class='line0'>Each heart’s warm incense is ascending,</p>
<p class='line0'>Praise to high heaven, each humble prayer</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh, finds it not acceptance there?</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> princely pile, known as Somerset House,
remains even to this day unfinished, and at the time
of our story was, with the exception of one block,
scarcely raised above its foundations. The large
square court and every empty space, for many rods
around its site, were cumbered with building materials.
Piles of rude stone—beds of newly made mortar—window-sashes,
with the lead and rich glass
that composed them, crushed together from the carelessness
with which they had been flung down—cornices
with the gilding yet fresh upon them—great
fragments of carved oak—beams of timber with flags
of marble, and even images of saints, broken as they
were torn from their niches, lay heaped together promiscuously
and with a kind of sacrilegious carelessness.
That block of the building, which runs parallel
with the river, alone was completed, while that portion
of the square, which forms its angle on the strand, was
built to the second story so far as the great arched
entrance. But all the rest was only massed out by
a line of rough stones sunk into the earth, and in
places almost concealed by the heaps of rubbish
which we have described.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Notwithstanding the unfinished state of his palace
the Lord Protector had taken possession of that portion
already completed, and from the sumptuous—nay,
almost regal magnificence of its adornments,
seemed determined to rival his royal nephew and
king, in state, as he had already done in power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have been particular in describing the Lord
Protector’s residence, for, at the time our story
resumes its thread, it contained the leading personages
who rendered themselves conspicuous in the
St. Margaret’s riot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more the gray of morning hung over the city
of London, a faint hum of voices and the sound of
busy feet rose gradually within its bosom. With the
earliest glimmer a host of workmen came to their
daily toil upon the palace, and were seen in the yet
dim light swarming upon the heaps of material
gathered in the court, and creeping, like ants drawn
from their mound, along the damp walls and the
scaffolding that bristled over them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though the hum and bustle of busy life swelled
and deepened in the streets the light was not yet
strong enough to penetrate the masses of heavy
velvet which muffled three tall windows of a chamber
overlooking the Thames, and a slope of rich, but
trampled sward that rolled greenly down to its brink.
So thick and deeply folded were the curtains that it
was broad day in the streets, though the sun had not
yet risen, before sufficient light penetrated the chamber
to draw out the objects which it contained from
the deep tranquil gloom that surrounded them. By
degrees a soft, warm light came stealing through a
fold or two of the crimson drapery as if a shower of
wine were dashed against them, very faint and rich
it was, but sufficient to reveal a mantelpiece of
clouded marble surmounting an immense fire-place
at one end of the room—tall chairs of dark wood,
heavily covered with cushions of crimson leather
enveloped with gold, standing in solemn magnificence
around, and a massive bed supported by
immense posts of ebony, each carved like the stems
of a great vine twisted together and coiling upward
to the ceiling, where they branched off and twined
together, a superb cornice of foliage cut from the
polished wood, and intermingled with clusters of
fruit so roundly carved that they seemed ready to
break loose from the rich workmanship of tendrils
and leaves which bedded them. The broad footboard
was carved to a perfect net-work; its glittering
black only relieved by the Somerset crest exquisitely
emblazoned in the centre. The head was surmounted
by a slab of broad ebony even more elaborately
wrought than the other, more nicely touched
and interworked like a specimen of Chinese ivory.
In the centre, just over the pillows, a basket of
golden apples gleamed through the delicate dark
tracery, which seemed to prison it, and caught the
first faint light that struggled through the windows.
As this light deepened and grew stronger within the
room, a counterpane of purple velvet sweeping over
the bed began to glow, as if the grapes above were
red, and had been shaken during the night over the
lovely girl who lay in an unquiet slumber beneath it.
The counterpane was disturbed and lay in purple
waves over the bed—for the Lady Jane Seymour
had started up more than once during the morning,
and after gazing wildly about in the dim light, sunk
to her pillow again, in that state of unquiet drowsiness,
which is neither wakefulness nor repose. Now
and then, as she seemed most soundly asleep, her
lips moved with restless murmurs, and her fair brow
was knitted as if in pain beneath the crushed lace
of her night-coif. She was lying thus with closed
eyes, and yet scarcely asleep, when a door opened,
and the old woman who had escaped from the riot
on the previous day, stole softly into the chamber,
bearing in her arms a bundle of green rushes and a
basket of flowers—humble things, but fresh and with
the night dew yet upon them. She laid her burthen
on the floor, and approaching the bed on tipt-toe,
bent down and kissed the small hand which crept
out from a fold of the counterpane, as if the beautiful
sleeper had been half aware of her approach.
More than once did the kind nurse bend over and
caress her charge, but timidly and as if fearful of
arousing her. At length she went to her basket, took
a bunch of wild violets from the blossoms it contained
and laid them upon the pillow. A faint smile
beamed over that fair face as the perfume stole over
it, and Lady Jane murmured softly as one who
received pleasure in a dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The nurse hurried away, and untying her rushes,
began to scatter them over the oaken floor. After
casting down a few of the flowers upon the fragrant
carpet, she selected others to fill an antique little vase
which stood on a table richly wrought, like everything
in the chamber, and surmounted by a mirror
which hung against the wall, in a frame of ebony and
gold, twined and drawn heavily together. The light
was yet very dim, so the good nurse cautiously drew
back a fold of the window-curtain. A sun-beam shot
through and broke over the steel mirror plate, as if a
golden arrow had been shivered there. A flood of
light, more than she had intended to admit, filled the
chamber and completely aroused the Lady Jane.
She started up in her couch, gazed wildly upon her
nurse, who stood almost terrified by what she had
done, with the half filled vase suspended over the
table, and then bending her head down upon her
hand, seemed lost in thought, which ended in a fit of
weeping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nurse,” she said at last, but without lifting her
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old woman set down her vase, and moving to
the bed drew the young girl to her bosom, and putting
back her night-cap, affectionately smoothed the bright
hair gathered beneath it, with her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me all that happened, good nurse,” said the
Lady at length, “I know that something is wrong, that
I have been in strange places, and amid a host of
people, but it all seems very long since, and strange,
like the dreams that haunt one in sickness.” She
paused awhile, very thoughtfully, and resumed what
she was saying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were with me, and I remember now! they
whirled you away in the crowd. There was a little
evil looking man came to me after that. He rode by
them. The church! the altar! that window! and
Lord Dudley in the grasp of rude soldiers! Nurse—tell
me, where is the Duke? where is my father? I
must see my father! Go to him, and say that his
daughter has been ill, very ill, and would speak with
him before he rides forth for the morning. Go quickly,
I am very well, and can robe myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she uttered these hasty directions, the Lady
Jane flung back the bed-drapery, and springing to
the floor, snatched a robe from the chair to which it
had been flung on the previous night, and thrusting
her arms into the loose sleeves, began eagerly and
with trembling fingers, to knot the silken cord which
bound it to her waist. All at once her hands dropped
from the task, and her exalted features contracted
with a sudden and most painful thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not go,” she said in a stifled voice, but without
lifting her face, “It was my father who bade
them tear the church down upon me. It was he who
flung Lord Dudley back among those bad men. Do
not go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The nurse, who had seemed reluctant to perform
the mission desired of her, returned, and taking up
her young lady’s slippers, knelt down to place them
on her feet, which were heedlessly pressing the chill
floor, but putting the good woman gently aside, Lady
Jane began to pace slowly up and down the apartment,
sweeping the rushes with her loose robe, and
crushing beneath her small white feet, the wild blossoms
that had been scattered among them. At length
she stopped suddenly and clasping her hands, turned
a look full of wild anguish upon the good woman,
who stood meekly by the bed, with the rejected slippers
in her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you think that my father would ever have
cursed <span class='it'>me</span>?” she said. “That he would revile the
bravest and most noble being in all England, before
a mob of riotous men; that he would let them seize
him and trample me to the earth; <span class='it'>me</span>, his youngest
child—who loved him so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, sweet Lady—you have been ill, and all this
is a feverish fancy. You should have seen with
what tenderness my Lord The Duke, bore you up
from the barge, in his own arms, and would not rest
till we brought him word that you were safe in bed
here, and asleep,” replied the nurse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Jane shook her head and smiled sadly. “It
was no dream,” she said, “dreams are of the fancy,
but such things as happened yesterday, sink into the
soul, and will not pass away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet,” replied the dame, “it was but now the
Lord Duke took such care of your repose, my gentle
Lady, that he forbade the workmen wielding a hammer
or crowbar in the court, lest your rest might be
disturbed too early. I met him scarcely ten minutes
since, on the way to his closet, where he is about to
examine my Lord Dudley, and that strange looking
man who was brought here on his lordship’s horse,
while the brave young gentleman came by water
with a pack of soldiers at his heels. The Duke, your
father, was in haste, but he took occasion to inquire
after your welfare, and bade me observe that no one
entered this chamber, or disturbed you in the least,
till you were quite restored.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Jane took the slippers from her attendant’s
hand, and hastily thrusting her feet into them, began
to arrange her dress once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Said you that Lord Dudley was with my father
now?” she enquired, turning from the steel mirror,
before which she was hurriedly twisting up her hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He may not have left his prisoner in the new
rooms near the arch yet,” replied the dame, “but I
heard the Duke give orders that he should be brought
out directly with that fellow in the sheep-skin cap.
If we were but on the other side, nothing would be
easier than to see them with the guard, filing through
the court.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And has my father gone so far? Lord Dudley
imprisoned in our own dwelling with a felon knave
like that?” murmured Lady Jane, folding her arms
and looking almost sternly upon the floor, “alas,
what is his offence, what is mine, that a parent, once
so good and kind should deal thus cruelly with us!”
Tears gathered in her eyes as she spoke, and advancing
to the nurse she took her arm, and moved
resolutely toward the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whither are you going my lady?” said the nurse,
turning pale with apprehension.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To my father,” replied Lady Jane calmly, “I
would learn the nature of my offence, and if accusation
is brought against my affianced husband I
would stand by his side. Do not turn pale and tremble,
nurse, I am not the child which I went forth
yesterday, though but a day older; intense suffering
is more powerful than time, and I almost think that
my youth has departed forever. Let us go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dare not,” replied the old woman, “the duke
has forbidden it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I also a prisoner, and in my father’s house?”
demanded the lady, “well, be it so! When the falcon
is caged the poor dove should but peck idly
against her wires,” and sitting down the unhappy
girl folded her arms on the dressing-table, where she
wept in bitterness of heart. The noise of heavy
feet passing along the corridor to which her chamber
opened aroused her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the soldiers with Lord Dudley in charge,”
said the nurse in reply to her questioning look, “I
will go and see.” The good woman arose and softly
opening the door looked out. Lady Jane gazed after
her with intense earnestness. When she stepped
into the passage and the sound of low voices came
into the room the anxious young creature could restrain
herself no longer, for the tones were familiar
and made her heart thrill, burthened as it was with
sorrow. She moved eagerly toward the door, and,
as it was swung open by the returning nurse, caught
one glance of Lord Dudley’s face. It was stern and
pale as death. He saw her and tried to smile, but
the rude voice of a soldier bade him move on; he
was hereby excited and the effort was lost in a proud
curve of the lips, which chilled the unhappy young
creature who gazed so breathlessly upon him. It
was the first time that she had ever seen a shadow
of bitterness on those lips, for her presence had
always a power to bring sunshine to them in his
sternest mood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what changes has one day brought,” she
murmured, burying her face once more upon the
table, “my father’s curse upon me—Dudley, my
Dudley, estranged. My mother—alas! when has
the morning dawned that her kiss failed to greet me.
Now, on this wretched day,” she broke off, locked
the small hands which covered her face more firmly
together, and again murmured, “Heaven help me,
for I am alone!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not alone—is your old nurse of no account?
If they have made her your jailor is she not a kind
one?” said the good-hearted attendant, bending over
her weeping charge. “Come, take heart, lady-bird,
dark days cannot last forever; the stars, so beautiful
and bright, are sometimes lost in black clouds, but
they always find a time to shine out again. The
duke cannot intend to deal harshly with you or he
would never have appointed your own fond old nurse
keeper to your prison. Besides, Lord Dudley will
be set free directly; he bade me tell you that a messenger
had been sent to the staunch old earl, his
father, and that another night would not find him
submitting to insult and confinement like the last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Jane ceased to weep, but still remained sad
and thoughtful; she was troubled and grieved by the
absence of her mother. It seemed as if every thing
she loved had deserted her, save the good old nurse.
But she was naturally a cheerful light-hearted creature,
and storms must sweep over such hearts again
and again before hope is entirely driven forth. She
was even smiling with some degree of her old mischievous
playfulness at the pompous way in which
the good nurse flourished her badge of office, a huge
key which had not yet been put in requisition, when
the door was pushed gently open and a lady of mature
but delicate loveliness entered the room. She
was very pale. Her eyes, naturally dark and mild,
were full of troubled light, and flushed a little, as if
she had just been weeping. Her morning robe was
slightly disordered, and the head dress of jewels and
velvet, which ornamented, without concealing her
beautiful hair, was placed a little too much on one
side, a sure sign of agitation in one usually so fastidious
regarding her toilet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Jane was still listening with a languid smile
to the well-intended prattle of her nurse, and the
door opened, so quietly that she was not apprised of
her approach, till the duchess stood close by her
side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a glad exclamation, and like an infant pining
for its mother’s presence, she started up with an
affectionate impulse, and flung her arms around the
lady, then bending her head back, and looking fondly
in her face, murmured—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear mother, have you come at last?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The duchess bent her face to that of the affectionate
creature clinging to her neck, but there was constraint
in the action, and no kiss followed it. Her
daughter felt this as a repulse, and gently unclasping
her hands, stood without support, looking with a
kind of regretful fondness in the face which had
never dwelt frowningly on her before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! mother, how can you look upon me thus—how
have I deserved it!” she said at last, striving to
check the tears which would spring to her eyes;
“How is it that every one turns coldly from me.
You, my kind and gentle mother,—you, that have
never sent me to rest without a blessing, who scarce
would let the light kiss my forehead till your lips
had pressed it in the morning. You are growing
distrustful like the rest. I did not think a mother’s
love would chill so easily—that <span class='it'>my</span> mother could
even find it in her heart to look harshly on her child.
Nay, mother,—dear, dear, mother, do not weep so—I
did not think to grieve you thus deeply. Why do
your lips tremble? Why do you wring my hand so?
What wrong have I done? I entreat you tell me
all—my heart will break unless you love me as of
old.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The duchess was much affected, but still maintained
the severity of manner which she had brought
into the room, though it evidently cost her a strong
effort to resist the appeal of her child. She sat down
upon the bed, and, drawing Lady Jane before her,
took the small hands, clasped together, in both hers,
and looked searchingly into the soft brown eyes that
met her gaze, not without anxiety, but still with a
trustful fondness that would have disarmed a firmer
heart than that which beat so full of generous and
affectionate impulses in the bosom of that noble lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jane,” she said at last, glancing at the slender
fingers locked in her own, “where is the ring which
I gave you on the duke’s last birth-day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Jane started at the question, and withdrawing
her hand, cast a quick glance upon it, and then
turned anxiously to the old woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My careful nurse here, must have taken it from
my finger as I slept,” she said, doubtingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old woman shook her head, and Lady Jane
turned earnestly to her mother, perplexed alike by
the loss of her ring, and the strange effect which it
produced on the duchess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When did you wear it last?” enquired the lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young lady mused for a few moments, and
then mentioned the previous day as that when she
remembered to have seen it on her finger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, I remember well,” said the nurse. “It was
on my lady’s hand when she lifted it to chide Richard
for his outcry in the crowd. Just then I was carried
off by the mob, and jostled about till it seemed a
miracle that I ever reached the barge again. I mind
now that Richard saw the ring also, for when we all
met at the landing, and sat waiting, hour after hour,
in hopes that some blessed chance would direct the
poor lady how to find us, I would have gone back
in search of her, but he forbade me, saying, that no
harm would befall a lady of her high condition while
she carried on her fingers the power to purchase
protection; so, when the night closed in, we rowed
down the river, just in time to see the sweet child
borne to her chamber, more dead than alive, with
the ill-treatment she had received.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The duchess turned her eyes earnestly on the
nurse as she spoke, but if she thought to detect anything
but an honest spirit of truth in those withered
features, her scrutiny was unrewarded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How chanced it,” she said, turning again to her
daughter, “how chanced it that you were entangled
in the mob near St. Margaret’s, when you went forth
to enjoy the morning breeze upon the river?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Jane looked surprised at the question, but
answered it without hesitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was very early,” she said, “and the air blew
chill on the water, so I bade the men pull up at Westminster
Bridge, intending to take a walk in the Park,
and return home, but as we were crossing up from
the river, the crowd came upon us, and in my terror
I was separated from my attendants and sought shelter
as I best could.” Lady Jane then proceeded to
inform her mother of the events which we have
already described in two previous chapters; but she
had been so dreadfully terrified that her narrative
was confused, and though it possessed all the simplicity
and force of truth, the disappearance of the
ring still appeared a mystery, for she could in no
way account for the manner in which it had left her
possession, but stood pale and utterly overwhelmed
with astonishment when informed of the charge
brought against her by the artisan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And did my father believe this of me?” she said,
turning to the duchess in the anguish of an upright
spirit unjustly accused. “I could not suspect any
one I loved of a base thing! Yet has my father,
whom I honored and worshipped so, not only condemned
but reviled me in the presence of my affianced
husband, and all on the word of a base man,
more despicable far, than the rudest workman who
breaks stone in his court yonder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a newly aroused pride in the young
girl’s bosom that gave dignity to the words she
uttered. A rich color broke over her cheek, and, for
the first time, those soft eyes kindled with indignation
as they fell upon her mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me go,” she continued, “let me stand face
to face with my accuser. It is not well that the
daughter of a noble house—the cousin of an English
Monarch, should be tried and condemned, without
hearing, on the word of a base varlet picked
up amid the dregs of a mob.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Duchess gazed upon the excited young creature
before her with mingled feelings of surprise,
regret, and, perhaps, some little share of anger, that
she could so easily depart from the humility of her
usual deportment, for though a fond parent, she had
even been rigid in her exactions of deference and
respect from her children. The love of a mother is
very powerful, but the pride of a high born English-woman,
educated for her station, is, perhaps, the
strongest feeling of her nature. The duchess felt
the truth of all that her daughter had said, but she
felt its boldness also, and her nice feelings were
shocked by it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your father had other reasons for doubting the
integrity of Lord Dudley—for it would seem that this
strange outbreak is occasioned as much by his
imprisonment as your own,” said the lady in a tone
of grave reproof, dropping her daughter’s hand.
“We have good cause to fear that the earl, his father,
has been tampering with the young king, and that he
is using all secret means to supplant my noble lord
in the power and station which he now fills. He
has left no means untried to gain popularity in the
city. That Lord Dudley has dared to appear against
the Lord Protector, heading a mob almost in open
rebellion, is proof that evil exists, and is spreading
through the court. My lord has taken prompt measures,
and in this should not be arraigned by his own
child. If the Lord of Warwick and his son are still
loyal to the Protector let them prove it before the
king. But from this hour it is the duke’s pleasure
that the contract existing between the two houses be
at an end forever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Jane stood perfectly motionless and pale as
marble when her mother finished speaking, but after
a moment she moved across the room and glided
through the door without speaking a word, and, as
if unconscious of the presence she had left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor young lady,” muttered the nurse, wiping
her eyes and casting a look, which would have been
reproachful but for awe, upon the duchess—“her
heart was almost broken before, but this will be the
death of her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peace, good dame, peace,” said the Duchess of
Somerset, in her usual calm and dignified manner.
“My daughter must learn to make sacrifices when
the honor of her house is concerned. From the first
I acquitted her of all wrong intention regarding the
diamond, and I deeply grieve at the annoyance it
has produced both to her and us. But regarding
Lord Dudley and his alliance with your young mistress—it
can never be thought of again. Let it be
your duty, good dame, as the most cherished attendant
of my child, to reconcile her to the change.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With these words the Duchess of Somerset left the
chamber just in time to see the Lady Jane disappear
from the extreme end of the corridor which led to
the duke’s closet.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Beautiful</span>, bewitching May! How shall I describe
her? As the fanciful village-poet, her devoted adorer,
declared;—“The pencil that would paint her charms
should be made of sunbeams and dipped in the dewy
heart of a fresh moss-rose.” Whether this same bundle
of beams and fragrant rose-dew would have done
full justice to her eloquent loveliness, I cannot pretend
to say—having never attempted the use of any
brush less earthly than are made of hog’s bristles,
nor any color more refined than a preparation from
cochineal. Her eyes were “blue as Heaven,” the
heaven of midsummer—when its warm, intense and
glorious hue seems deepening as you gaze, and
laughing in the joyous light of day. Her hair, I could
never guess its true color; it was always floating in
such exquisite disorder over her happy face and
round white shoulders—now glistening, glowing in
the sunshine, like wreaths of glossy gold, and now,
in shadow, bathing her graceful neck with soft brown
waves, that looked like silken floss, changing forever
and lovely in each change. Blushes and dimples
played hide and seek on her face. Her lip—her
rich sweet lip was slightly curved—just enough to
show that there was pride as well as love in her
heart. She was, indeed, a spirited creature. Her
form was of fairy moulding, but perfect though
“petite!” and her motions graceful as those of the
Alpine chamois.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reader, if I have failed in my attempt to convey
to you an image of youthful grace, beauty and sweetness,
I pray you repair my deficiency from the stores
of your own lively imagination, and fancy our dear
May Evelyn the loveliest girl in the universe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now for her history. Her father, of an ancient
and noble family, had married, in early life, a beautiful
but extravagant woman, who died a few years
after their union, leaving him with two lovely children
and an all but exhausted fortune. On her death
he retired from the gay world, and settled with his
infant treasures in Wales, and there, husbanding his
scanty means, he contrived to live in comfort if not
in luxury. There, too, brooding over the changes of
human life—the fallacy of human foresight, and the
fickleness of human friendship, he became “a sadder
and a wiser man.” His two beautiful children,
Lionel and May, were the idols of his heart, and
well did they repay his love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>May’s first serious trouble arose from hearing her
father express one day his desire to purchase for
Lionel a commission in the army. The boy was
high-spirited and intelligent, and had cherished from
childhood an ardent desire for military life; but there
was no possibility of raising sufficient money for the
purpose, without sacrificing many of their daily
comforts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this time May was just sixteen; but there was
in her face a childlike purity and innocence, which,
combined with her playful simplicity of manner, made
her appear even younger than she was. She hated
study, except in the volume of nature; there indeed
she was an apt and willing pupil. Birds and streams
and flowers were her favorite books; but though
little versed in the lore of her father’s well-stored
library—she had undoubted genius, and whenever
she did apply herself, could learn with wonderful
rapidity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The only science, however, in which she was a
proficient, was music:—for this she had an excellent
ear and, when a mere child, ere her father’s removal
to Wales, had been under the tuition of a celebrated
master. Her voice was rich, sweet and powerful,
and her execution on the guitar, piano and harp, was
at once brilliant and expressive. She had, also, a
pretty talent for versifying, and often composed
music for words, which, if not remarkable for power
or polish, were certainly bewitching when sung by
their youthful authoress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During most of the day, on the morning of which
Mr. Evelyn first mentioned his wishes with regard to
Lionel, the sunny face of our heroine was clouded
with sorrowful thought; but towards evening, as her
father sat alone in his library, the door suddenly
opened, and May, bounding in, her eyes beaming
with enthusiasm, exclaimed—“Papa! papa! I
have just thought—I know what I’ll do!—I’ll be a
governess.” Her father gazed at her in astonishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A governess, May! What can have put such
an idea into your head? Why should you be a governess?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! for Lionel, you know. I can soon earn
enough to buy his commission.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it is this then, my child,” said Mr. Evelyn,
tenderly, “that has so repressed your usual spirits!”
But while he spoke seriously, he could scarcely
repress a smile at the thought of the wild, childlike
being before him, transformed into a staid, dignified
teacher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the six weeks following, the devoted girl
deprived herself of all her usual outdoor amusements,
and, with wonderful energy applied, under
her father’s guidance, to study. At the end of that
time, she laughingly declared that she knew a little
of everything; but still her passion for birds and
flowers was far greater than for books.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ere the six weeks had well expired, she heard from
some young friends, who were on a visit to Wales,
from London, that the earl of —— was in want of
a governess for his four children. She begged them,
on their return, to mention her. This they did, and
with youthful exaggeration extolled her talents to the
skies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Earl understanding that she was the accomplished
and amiable daughter of an aged naval officer,
saw, in his mind’s eye, a learned lady of a certain
age, who would, perhaps, prove a mother in kindness
and usefulness to his orphan children, and gladly
acceded to the desire of his young friends, that he
should make trial of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The poor things were not aware what a little ignoramus
they were recommending; for the youthful
Lionel, who, sometimes took a peep into the library,
and stared in surprise at the various apparatus for
study, had boasted all over the village in which they
resided, that his sister knew everything under the
sun, and had mentioned, in corroboration of this
sweeping declaration, that she was always poring
over French, Spanish, Greek or Latin books. This,
her enthusiastic young friends, who, by the way, had
only known her a fortnight, took care to make the
most of—and the result was, that May was considered,
by the Earl, as a most fitting instructress for
his children, and dreaded by them as a prim and
severe restraint upon their hitherto unchecked amusements.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was the morning of the day on which the
dreaded governess was expected, Julia, Elizabeth,
Georgiana and William—the first 15, the second 10,
the third 8, and the fourth 7 years of age, were at
play in the garden of the Earl’s country seat. They
had heard awful things of governesses from some of
their young companions, and the younger children had
been whispering to each other their dread of the
expected tyrant. They had, however, resumed their
gambols, and forgotten the matter, with that charming
versatility which makes them so interesting, when
their nurse appeared with the news that the governess
had arrived, and was waiting to be introduced to
her young charge in the school-room. A sudden change
was observable on the countenances of all. It was
amusing to watch the expression on each of those
young faces. Julia—the pensive and graceful Julia
sighed, and bent her soft eyes sadly on the ground, as
she instantly turned her steps towards the house.
The little wilful and spirited Willie began to strut
manfully backward and forward, declaring that the
others might do as they liked, but that <span class='it'>he</span> would not
go near the ugly old woman. Georgy pouted—and
Lizzie burst into tears. At the sound of weeping,
Julia turned back—soothed and cheered them all by
turns—kissed away the tears of one sister—smoothed
the other’s frowning brow with her soft and loving
hand, and laughed at Willie till he was fain to join
in the laugh in spite of himself. She then desired
them to follow her to the school-room—which they
did—clinging to her dress, however, as if they expected
to see a monster in the shape of a governess;
but as they reached the flight of steps which led
from the lawn to the house, their courage failed, and,
leaving Julia to ascend alone, they suddenly and
simultaneously turned to escape, and hurrying away,
concealed themselves in the garden, where they soon
resumed their sports.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime Julia had ascended the steps and
stood gazing in silent astonishment through the glass
door opening into the school-room. The object of
her dread was there—but not as she had pictured
her—a prim, severe old-maid. A girl apparently
younger than herself, with a sweet glowing face,
shaded by a profusion of lovely hair,—her straw
bonnet flung on the floor, and her simple white dress
looking anything but old-maidish—was stooping to
caress their favorite dog, Carlo, while the pet-parrot
sat perched on her shoulder, mingling his gorgeous
plumage with her light brown curls, and crying with
all his might, “old-maid governess! old-maid governess!”
As our heroine raised her head, wondering
at the strange salutation, (which, by the way, master
Willie had been maliciously teaching him for some
time previous,) her eyes encountered those of the
smiling Julia, who, equally surprised and delighted
at the scene, already saw, in Miss Evelyn, a friend
after her own heart, such an one as she had long
ardently desired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this critical moment, the good old nurse entered
from the lawn, and seeing the mutual embarrassment
of the parties, said simply to May—“This is your
oldest pupil, madam.” At the words “madam” and
“pupil,” both May and Julia tried hard to repress
the smiles which would peep through their eyes and
lips—in vain. The dimples on the cheek of the
youthful governess grew deeper and deeper—Julia’s
dark eyes flashed through their drooping fringes more
and more brightly, and, at length, the smothered merriment
burst irresistibly forth. No sooner had the
latter’s eye caught the arch glance and her ear the
musical laugh of May, than she sprang forward to
clasp her readily extended hand, exclaiming, “I am
sure you will be my friend!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I will,” said May, “if you won’t call me
‘old-maid governess’ again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old-maid governess, old-maid governess,”
screamed the parrot from his cage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>May began to look grave, and Julia, blushing with
vexation, led her gently to the cage, outside of the
door, and pointed to the bird in silence. “How
stupid I was!” exclaimed May; “I quite forgot the
parrot when I saw that beautiful dog. I do so love
dogs—don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes! but I love you better,” said Julia, affectionately,
throwing her arm around her new friend’s
neck, and sealing her avowal with a kiss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment, Willie was seen peeping and
stealing slyly round the shrubbery—his roguish face
subdued to as demure a look as it could possibly
assume. For a moment he stared at the pair in
amazement, and then clapping his hands, he shouted,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Georgy! Lizzie! Georgy! come and see Julia
kissing the governess!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! you lovely boy!” exclaimed May—bounding
down the steps, “I must have a kiss!” and away
she flew after the little rosy rogue—he laughing so
heartily as to impede his progress, till at last helpless,
from very glee, he fell into her arms, and allowed
her to kiss him half a dozen times before he remembered
that she was the teacher so dreaded by them
all. When he did recollect, he looked up half incredulously
in her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not old!” said he,—“no, nor yet prim,
nor cross. I don’t think you are so very ugly either,
and maybe you don’t know much after all. I say,
governess, if you please, ma’am, can you spin a
top?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” said May.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurrah! I thought so—hurrah, Georgy! she don’t
know so much as I do now—hurrah! hurrah! I’ll
stand by her for one!” and, tossing his hat in the
air, he sprang into the lap of May, who had sank
into a low rustic seat, quite exhausted from her exercise—her
cheeks glowing—her hair in disorder, and
her lips parted with smiling delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time the two little girls, who had been peeping
a long while, ventured, followed by Julia, to approach;—Georgiana
leading, or rather dragging the
shy but lovely little Lizzie in one hand, and holding
in the other a freshly gathered rose-bud, which she
timidly presented to our heroine, as if to bribe her
not to be harsh with them. May stooped to kiss the
intelligent face whose dark and eloquent eyes looked
so pleadingly into hers; while Julia, who stood behind
her, stole the rose from her hand. “Let me
wreathe it in your hair,” she said. At that moment,
while she was yet engaged in her graceful task, the
Earl suddenly appeared before them. It must be
remembered that he had seen, from his library window,
the before-mentioned chase, and rather curious
to know who the beautiful visiter could be, (not
having been apprised of Miss Evelyn’s arrival,) he
had followed them to the spot on which they were
now assembled—May on the seat, parting the dark
curls from Lizzie’s bashful and downcast brow;
Willie on her knee; Georgy gazing up in her face,
and Julia placing the rose-bud in her hair. All started
at the sudden appearance of the Earl. Willie sprang
to his arms, and little Lizzie, afraid of every new
comer, laid her curly head on the knee of her newly-found
friend, and turned up her bright eyes inquiringly
to her father’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not let me disturb your play, my children,”
said the Earl. “I only come to remind you, that
your governess will soon be here, and that you must
welcome her with respect and attention. But, Julia,
you must introduce me to this merry young friend
of yours, who runs as if her heart were in her
feet;” and so saying, he playfully patted the drooping
head of the blushing and embarrassed girl, who, all
this while, had been striving to hide her fears and
her confusion by pretending to be deeply occupied in
twisting Lizzie’s silken ringlets round her little taper
finger. The moment she had heard Willie exclaim,
“papa!” all her former dread of that awful personage
returned, and, with it, for the first time, a full
sense of her own inefficiency to perform the task she
had undertaken. His voice so deep and yet so sweet
and playful, banished half her dread, but only
increased her confusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julia, however, came instantly to her relief, with
a tact and delicacy uncommon in one so young—saying
simply and seriously, “This is our governess,
papa. Miss Evelyn, this is our dear papa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Earl started back,—tried to repress his smiles,
bowed low to conceal them, and then taking her
hand respectfully in his, bade her welcome to the
castle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The word “governess” had acted like a spell upon
May’s faculties; it restored her to a sense of the
dignity of her situation, and rising instantly and
drawing her beautiful form to its full height, she
received and returned the compliments of the Earl
with a graceful dignity and self-possession, that
astonished him, as much as it awed the poor children.
And when, in his courteous reply, he begged her
pardon for his mistake, in a tone at once gentle and
deferential, she found courage, for the first time, to
raise her eyes. It was no stern, old, pompous nobleman,
such as her fears had portrayed, who stood
before her, but an elegant man, in the prime of life,
with a noble figure and singularly handsome face,
full of genius and feeling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His dark eyes were bent upon her with a gaze of
mingled curiosity and admiration; but, as they met
hers, he recollected himself, and wishing her and
his children good morning, and resigning Willie, as
if it were a thing of course, to her arms, (a circumstance,
by the way, which he could not help smiling
at half an hour afterwards,) he passed on and left
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now came innumerable questions from all but
the silent Georgy, who contented herself with nestling
close to the side of our heroine as they wandered
through the grounds—and gazing with her large soft
eyes into her face, now dimpled with the light of
mirth, now softening into tenderness, and now shadowed
by a passing thought of “papa, and Lionel,
and home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And oh!” said Lizzie, “you won’t take away my
doll and make me study all the time, will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed, darling! I would much rather help
you dress your doll.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I may spin my top all day if I like—may I
not?” asked Willie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, if papa is willing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! but papa told us to obey all your commands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Commands,” thought May, “oh, dear, I shall
never do for a governess!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day passed on in sport. Our heroine’s duties
were to commence on the next; but she would not
allow her fears for the morrow to interfere with her
present delight. In the meantime, the Earl, amid his
important duties, was haunted all day by one bewitching
image;—a fair sweet face glanced brightly up
from every book he opened, from every paper to
which he referred; and, in his dreams that night,
he led to the altar a second bride, more lovely, more
beloved than the first.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Early the next morning, as May sat teaching
Willie to read, with a demure face, through which
the rebel dimples would peep in spite of her assumed
dignity; while Julia, with a look equally demure,
was bending over an Italian book; Georgy drawing,
and Lizzie hemming a wee bit ’kerchief for her doll—the
Earl entered the school-room from the lawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unseen, he paused at the open door to contemplate
the lovely tableau within;—the governess in her
pretty girlish morning dress, with her long ringlets
shadowing half her face and neck, as she bent over
the boy, pointing out to him the word;—Willie by
her side—one hand holding the book, the other his
top, kicking the chair impatiently—first with one
foot, then with the other, and looking round every
minute to see what his sisters were doing;—Georgy
smiling as she drew; Lizzie sitting upright in her
little chair, with a doll almost as large as herself on
her lap, ever and anon trying the ’kerchief round its
neck to see the effect; and the simple, modest Julia,
looking even older than May, with her dark hair
smoothly parted—raising at times her eyes with
looks of loving sympathy to those of the youthful
teacher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was indeed a sunny scene; but the silence was
broken by the voice of Georgy requesting assistance
in her drawing. The young governess rose, and taking
her offered pencil, retouched the sketch in a few
places, at the same time giving the child directions
how to finish it. Suddenly the pencil trembled in
her hand,—the sweet low voice stopped—went on—faltered—ceased
again, and May burst into tears!
The Earl had stolen behind them to watch the
progress of the drawing. May had felt, rather than
heard, his approach,—and confused by his presence,
half suspecting her own deficiency in the art, yet
afraid to discontinue her directions at once, her face
suffused with blushes, she tried in vain to proceed.
Little Lizzie saw her tears, and springing from her
seat, climbed a chair to caress her, exclaiming,
“Don’t cry! papa won’t hurt you! Papa loves you
dearly—don’t you, papa?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here was a situation! It was now the Earl’s turn
to color; but the artless and innocent May, who
had as yet known only a father’s and a brother’s love,
did not dream of any other in the present case; on
the contrary, she was soothed by the affectionate
assurances of the child, and, smiling through her
tears, looked up confidingly in the Earl’s face.
Charmed with the childlike sweetness of her expression
he could not resist taking her hand, with almost
paternal tenderness, in his, while May, reassured by
the gentleness of his manner, ventured to acknowledge
her own ignorance, and to request his assistance
in the sketch before them. This, to the delight of all,
he willingly consented to give, and when, at two
o’clock, the nurse came to take the children to dinner,
she found May seated alone at the table, intent
on a newly commenced drawing—the Earl leaning
over her chair and instructing her in its progress—Julia
singing “Love’s Young Dream,” and the three
children gone no one knew where.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day, and the next, the Earl was still to be
found in the school-room, sometimes spinning Willie’s
top, sometimes reading an Italian author aloud to his
daughter and her governess—often sharing the book
with the latter, and oftener still, blending his rich and
manly voice with hers as she sang to the harp or
piano. One day a visiter asked Willie how he liked
his new governess? “Oh!” said the boy, “<span class='it'>papa</span> is
governess now. May is only our sister, and we are
all <span class='it'>so</span> happy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus passed a year—Julia and May daily improving
under their indulgent and unwearied teacher—and
imparting in their turn instruction to the younger
branches of the family. May had confided to Julia
all her little history. She had written often to her
father, and had received many letters in return.
From one of them she learned, to her great joy and
surprise, that Lionel had received his commission
from some unknown friend. At the same time, her
father advised her, as she had engaged for a year, to be
contented until the expiration of it. “Contented!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last day of the year had arrived—May had
lately been so happy that she had forgotten to think
of being separated from the family she loved so
much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the morning of the day, the Earl was in his
library, Julia making tea, and May on a low ottoman
at his feet, reading aloud the morning paper.
Suddenly she paused, dropped the paper, and covered
her face with her hands. The Earl, alarmed, bent
tenderly over her, and Julia was by her side in a
moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, dear May?” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the paper—look at the paper, Julia!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Earl caught it up—“Where—tell me where
to look, May?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the date—the date!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The date—it is the first of June—and what
then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! did I not <span class='it'>come</span> the first of June and must I
not go to-morrow? I am sure I shall never do for a
governess!” and she hid her face on Julia’s shoulder,
and wept afresh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Earl raised her gently—“Perhaps not; but
you will do for something else, sweet May!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For what?” she asked earnestly—half wondering
whether he could mean <span class='it'>housekeeper</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come into the garden with me, dear, dear May,
and I will tell you,” he whispered in her ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At once the whole truth flashed upon her heart.
“She loved—she was beloved!” She was no longer
a child—that moment transformed her; and shrinking
instantly from his embrace and blushing till
her very temples glowed again—she said in a low
and timid voice, “I think I had better go home
to-morrow—perhaps to-day: my father will expect
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Julia,” said the Earl, “run into the garden, love,
and see to Willie—he is in mischief, I dare say.” His
daughter was out of sight in a moment. May stood
shrinking and trembling, but unable to move. The
Earl gazed, with a feeling bordering upon reverence,
at the young girl, as she stood alone in her innocence.
He drew slowly towards her—hesitated—again
approached, and taking her hand with respectful
tenderness, he said—“You know that I love you,
May—how fondly—how fervently—time must show
for language cannot:—will you—<span class='it'>say</span> you will be
mine—with your father’s consent, dear May—or
say that I may hope!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her whole soul was in her eyes as she raised them
slowly to his and dropped them instantly again
beneath his ardent gaze. “But—papa!” she murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will all go together, and ask ‘papa,’ dearest;
and now for a turn in the garden. You will not refuse
now, love?” And May Evelyn, blushing and smiling,
took his offered arm, wondering what “dear papa
and Lionel” would say to all this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a lovely evening in the early part of June,
that, while Mr. Evelyn sat dozing in his arm chair
and dreaming of his absent children, a light form
stole over the threshold, and when he awoke, his gray
hair was mingled with the glistening locks of his own
beautiful and beloved May—his head resting on her
shoulder, and her kiss warm upon his cheek!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Lord,” said May, demurely, as she entered,
with her father, the drawing-room in which the Earl
awaited them—“papa is very glad that I have <span class='it'>given
satisfaction</span>;—he thinks your visit a proof of it—although
he could hardly have expected so much
from his little ignoramus, as he will persist in calling
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear sir,” said the Earl, cordially pressing
the offered hand of his host, “she has given <span class='it'>so much
satisfaction</span>, that I wish, with your consent, to retain
her as <span class='it'>governess</span> for life, not for my children, but
myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reader has already foreseen the conclusion.
Mr. Evelyn’s consent was obtained;—Lionel was
sent for to be present at the wedding;—the ceremony
was quietly performed in the little church of
the village;—and for many succeeding seasons in
London, the graceful and elegant wife of the Earl of
—— was “the observed of all observers,” “the
cynosure of neighboring eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>A cold</span> and dark northeaster had swept together a
host of straggling vapors and thin lowering clouds
over the French metropolis—the course of the Seine
might be traced easily among the grotesque roofs
and gothic towers which at that day adorned its
banks, by the gray ghostly mist which seethed up
from its sluggish waters—a small fine rain was falling
noiselessly and almost imperceptibly, by its own
weight as it were, from the surcharged and watery
atmosphere—the air was keenly cold and piercing,
although the seasons had not crept far as yet beyond
the confines of the summer. The trees, for there
were many in the streets of Paris and still more in
the fauxbourgs and gardens of the haute noblesse,
were thickly covered with white rime, as were the
manes and frontlets of the horses, the clothes, and
hair, and eyebrows of the human beings who ventured
forth in spite of the inclement weather. A
sadder and more gloomy scene can scarcely be conceived
than is presented by the streets of a large city
in such a time as that I have attempted to describe.
But this peculiar sadness was, on the day of which I
write, augmented and exaggerated by the continual
tolling of the great bell of St. Germain Auxerrois,
replying to the iron din which arose from the gray
towers of Notre Dâme. From an early hour of the
day the people had been congregating in the streets
and about the bridges leading to the precincts of the
royal palace, the Chateau des Tournelles, which
then stood—long since obliterated almost from the
memory of men—upon the Isle de Paris, the greater
part of which was covered then with the courts, and
terraces, and gardens of that princely pile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Strong bodies of the household troops were posted
here and there about the avenues and gates of the
royal demesne, and several large detachments of the
archers of the prevôt’s guard—still called so from the
arms which they had long since ceased to carry—might
be seen every where on duty. Yet there were
no symptoms of an émeute among the populace, nor
any signs of angry feeling or excitement in the features
of the loitering crowd, which was increasing
every moment as the day waxed toward noon.
Some feeling certainly there was—some dark and
earnest interest, as might be judged from the knit
brows, clinched hands, and anxious whispers which
every where attended the exchange of thought
throughout the concourse—but it was by no means of
an alarming or an angry character. Grief, wonder,
expectation, and a sort of half doubtful pity, as far as
might be gathered from the words of the passing
speakers, were the more prominent ingredients of
the common feeling, which had called out so large a
portion of the city’s population on a day so unsuited
to any spectacle of interest. For several hours this
mob, increasing as it has been described from hour
to hour, varied but little in its character, save that as
the day wore it became more and more respectable
in the appearance of its members. At first it had
been composed almost without exception of artisans
and shop boys, and mechanics of the lowest order,
with not a few of the cheats, bravoes, pickpockets,
and similar ruffians, who then as now formed a fraternity
of no mean size in the Parisian world. As
the morning advanced, however, many of the burghers
of the city, and respectable craftsmen, might be
seen among the crowd; and a little later many of the
secondary gentry and petite noblesse, with well-dressed
women and even children, all showing the
same symptoms of sad yet eager expectation. Now,
when it lacked but a few minutes of noon, long trains
of courtiers with their retinues and armed attendants,
many a head of a renowned and ancient house, many
a warrior famous for valor and for conduct might be
seen threading the mazes of the crowded thoroughfares
toward the royal palace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A double ceremony of singular and solemn nature
was soon to be enacted there—the interment of a
noble soldier, slain lately in an unjust quarrel, and
the investiture of an unwilling woman with the
robes of a holy sisterhood preparatory to her lifelong
interment in that sepulchre of the living body—sepulchre
of the pining soul—the convent cloisters.
Armand de Laguy!—Marguerite de Vaudreuil!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many circumstances had united in this matter to
call forth much excitement, much grave interest in
the minds of all who had heard tell of it!—the singular
and wild romance of the story, the furious and
cruel combat which had resulted from it—and last
not least, the violent, and, as it was generally considered,
unnatural resentment of the King toward
the guilty victim who survived the ruin she had
wrought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The story was in truth, then, but little understood—a
thousand rumors were abroad, and of course no
one accurately true—yet in each there was a share
of truth, and the amount of the whole was, perhaps,
less wide of the mark than is usual in matters of the
kind. And thus they ran. Marguerite de Vaudreuil
had been betrothed to the youngest of France’s
famous warriors, Charles de La-Hirè, who after a
time fell—as it was related by his young friend and
kinsman, Armand de Laguy—covered with wounds
and honor. The body had been found outstretched
beneath the surviver, who, himself desperately hurt,
had alone witnessed, and in vain endeavored to prevent,
his cousin’s slaughter. The face of Charles
de La-Hirè, as all men deemed the corpse to be, was
mangled and defaced so frightfully as to render recognition
by the features utterly hopeless—yet from
the emblazoned surcoat which it bore, the well-known
armor on the limbs, the signet ring upon the
finger, and the accustomed sword clenched in the
dead right hand, none doubted the identity of the
body, or questioned the truth of Armand’s story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Armand de Laguy, succeeding by his cousin’s
death to all his lands and lordships, returned to the
metropolis, mixed in the gayeties of that gay period,
when all the court of France was revelling in the celebration
of the union of the Dauphin with the lovely
Mary Stuart, in after days the hapless queen of Scotland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wore no decent and accustomed garb of mourning—he
suffered no interval, however brief, due to decorum
at least if not to kindly feeling, to elapse before
it was announced that Marguerite de Vaudreuil, the
dead man’s late betrothed, was instantly to wed his
living cousin. Her wondrous beauty, her all-seductive
manners, her extreme youth had in vain pleaded
against the general censure of the court—the world!
Men had frowned on her for awhile, and women
sneered and slandered!—but after a little while, as
the novelty of the story wore away, the indignation
against her inconstancy ceased, and she was once
again installed the leader of the court’s unwedded
beauties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly, on the very eve of her intended nuptials,
Charles de La-Hirè returned—ransomed, as it turned
out, by Brissac, from the Italian dungeons of the
Prince of Parma, and making fearful charges of
treason and intended murder against Armand de
Laguy. The King had commanded that the truth
should be proved by a solemn combat, had sworn to
execute upon the felon’s block whichever of the
two should yield or confess falsehood, had sworn
that the inconstant Marguerite, who, on the return of
De La-Hirè, had returned instantly to her former
feelings, asserting her perfect confidence in the truth
of Charles, the treachery of Armand, should either
wed the victor, or live and die the inmate of the most
rigorous convent in his realm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The battle had been fought yesterday!—Armand
de Laguy fell, mortally wounded by his wronged
cousin’s hand, and with his latest breath declared his
treasons, and implored pardon from his King, his
kinsman, and his God—happy to perish by a brave
man’s sword not by a headsman’s axe. And Marguerite—the
victor’s prize—rejected by the man she
had betrayed—herself refusing, even if he were willing,
to wed with him whom she could but dishonor—had
now no option save death or the detested cloister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now men pitied—women wept—all frowned
and wondered and kept silence. That a young, vain,
capricious beauty—the pet and spoiled child from her
very cradle of a gay and luxurious court—worshipped
for her charms like a second Aphrodite—intoxicated
with the love of admiration—that such an one should
be inconstant, fickle!—should swerve from her fealty
to the dead!—a questionable fealty always!—and be
won to a rash second love by the falsehood and treasons
of a man, young and brave and handsome—falsehood
which had deceived wise men—that such
should be the course of events, men said, was neither
strange nor monstrous! It was a fault, a lapse of
which she had been guilty, which might indeed make
her future faith suspected, which would surely justify
Charles de La-Hirè in casting back her proffered
hand, but which at the worst was venial, and deserving
no such doom as the soul-chilling cloister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had, they said, in no respect participated in the
guilt, or shared the treacheries of Armand—on the
contrary—she, the victim of his fraud, had been the
first to denounce, to spit at, to defy him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover it was understood that although de La-Hirè
had refused her hand, several of equal and
even higher birth than he had offered to redeem her
from the cloister by taking her to wife of their free
choice—Jarnac had claimed the beauty—and it was
whispered that the Duke de Nevers had sued to
Henry vainly for the fair hand of the unwilling
novice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the King was relentless. “Either the wife of
De La-Hirè!—or the bride of God in the cloister!”
was his unvarying reply. No farther answer would
he give—no disclosure of his motives would he make
even to his wisest councillors. Some indeed augured
that the good monarch’s anger was but feigned, and
that deeming her sufficiently punished already he
was desirous still of forcing her to be the bride of him
to whom she had been destined, and whom she still,
despite her brief inconstancy, unquestionably worshipped
in her heart. For all men still supposed that
at the last Charles would forgive the hapless girl,
and so relieve her from the living tomb that even
now seemed yawning to enclose her. But others—and
they were those who understood the best mood
of France’s second Henry—vowed that the wrath
was real; and felt, that, though no man could
fathom the cause of his stern ire, he never would
forgive the guilty girl, whose frailty, as he swore, had
caused such strife and bloodshed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now it was high noon, and forth filed from the
palace gates a long and glittering train—Henry and
all his court, with all the rank and beauty of the
realm, knights, nobles, peers and princes, damsels
and dames—the pride of France and Europe. But at
the monarch’s right walked one, clad in no gay attire—pale,
languid, wounded and warworn—Charles de
La-Hirè, the victor. A sad deep gloom o’ercast his
large dark eye, and threw a shadow over his massy
forehead—his lip had forgot to smile! his glance to
lighten! yet was there no remorse, no doubt, no
wavering in his calm, noble features—only fixed, settled
sorrow. His long and waving hair of the darkest
chesnut, evenly parted on his crown, fell down on
either cheek, and flowed over the broad plain collar
of his shirt which, decked with no embroidery lace,
was folded back over the cape of a plain black pourpoint,
made of fine cloth indeed, but neither laced
nor passemented, nor even slashed with velvet—a
broad scarf of black taffeta supported his weapon—a
heavy double-edged straight broadsword, and served
at the same time to support his left arm, the sleeve of
which hung open, tied in with points of ribbon. His
trunk-hose and his nether stocks of plain black silk,
black velvet shoes and a slouched hat, with neither
feather nor cockade, completed the suit of melancholy
mourning which he wore. In the midst of the train
was a yet sadder sight, Marguerite de Vaudreuil,
robed in the snow-white vestments of a novice, with
all her glorious ringlets flowing in loose redundance
over her shoulders and her bosom, soon to be cut
close by the fatal scissors—pale as the monumental
stone and only not as rigid. A hard-featured gray-headed
monk, supported her on either hand—and a
long train of priests swept after with crucifix and
rosary and censer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scarce had this strange procession issued from the
great gates of les Tournelles, the death-bells tolling
still from every tower and steeple, before another
train, gloomier yet and sadder, filed out from the gate
of the royal tilt-yard, at the farther end of which
stood a superb pavilion. Sixteen black Benedictine
monks led the array chanting the mournful <span class='it'>miserere</span>—next
behind these, strange contrast!—strode on the
grim gaunt form, clad in his blood-stained tabard,
and bearing full displayed his broad two-handed axe—fell
emblem of his odious calling!—the public executioner
of Paris. Immediately in the rear of this dark
functionary, not borne by his bold captains, nor followed
by his gallant vassals with arms reversed and
signs of martial sorrow, but ignominiously supported
by the grim-visaged ministers of the law, came on
the bier of Armand, the last Count de Laguy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stretched in a coffin of the rudest material and
construction, with his pale visage bare, displaying
still in its distorted lines and sharpened features the
agonies of mind and body which had preceded his
untimely dissolution, the bad but haughty noble was
borne to his long home in the grave-yard of Notre
Dâme. His sword, broken in twain, was laid across
his breast, his spurs had been hacked from his heels
by the base cleaver of the scullion, and his reversed
escutcheon was hung above his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Narrowly saved by his wronged kinsman’s intercession
from dying by the headsman’s weapon ere
yet his mortal wounds should have let out his spirit—he
was yet destined to the shame of a dishonored
sepulchre—such was the King’s decree, alas! inexorable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The funeral train proceeded—the King and his
court followed. They reached the grave-yard, hard
beneath those superb gray towers!—they reached
the grave, in a remote and gloomy corner, where, in
unconsecrated earth, reposed the executed felon—the
priests attended not the corpse beyond the precincts
of that unholy spot—their solemn chant died mournfully
away—no rites were done, no prayers were
said above the senseless clay—but in silence was it
lowered into the ready pit—silence disturbed only by
the deep hollow sound of the clods that fell fast and
heavy on the breast of the guilty noble! For many
a day a headstone might be seen—not raised by the
kind hands of sorrowing friends nor watered by the
tears of kinsmen—but planted there, to tell of his disgraceful
doom—amid the nameless graves of the
self-slain—and the recorded resting-places of well-known
thieves and felons. It was of dark gray free-stone,
and it bore these brief words—brief words, but
in that situation speaking the voice of volumes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three forms stood by the grave—stood till the last
clod had been heaped upon its kindred clay, and the
dark headstone planted. Henry, the King! and
Charles, the Baron De La-Hirè; and Marguerite de
Vaudreuil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as the last clod was flattened down upon the
dead, after the stone was fixed, De La-Hirè crossed
the grave to the despairing girl, where she had stood
gazing with a fixed rayless eye on the sad ceremony
and took her by the hand, and spoke so loud that
all might hear his words, while Henry looked on
calmly but not without an air of wondering excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not that I did not love thee,” he said, “Marguerite!
Not that I did not pardon thee thy brief inconstancy,
caused as it was by evil arts of which we
will say nothing now—since he who plotted them
hath suffered even above his merits, and is—we
trust—now pardoned! Not for these causes, nor for
any of them—have I declined thine hand thus far—but
that the King commanded, judging it in his
wisdom best for both of us. Now Armand is gone
hence—and let all doubt and sorrow go hence with
him! Let all your tears, all my suspicions be buried
in his grave forever. I take your hand, dear Marguerite—I
take you as mine honored and loved bride—I
claim you mine forever!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus far the girl had listened to him, not blushingly,
nor with a melting eye; nor with any sign of
renewed hope or rekindled happiness in her pale
features—but with cold resolute attention—but now
she put away his hand very steadily, and spoke with
a firm unfaltering voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be not so weak!” she said. “Be not so weak,
Charles de La-Hirè!—nor fancy me so vain! The
weight and wisdom of years have passed above my
head since yester morning—then was I a vain,
thoughtless girl—now am I a stern wise woman.
That I have sinned is very true—that I have betrayed
thee—wronged thee! It may be, had you spoke
pardon yesterday—it might have been all well! It
may be it <span class='it'>had been</span> dishonor in you to take me to
your arms—but if to do so had been dishonor yesterday,
by what is it made honor now? No! no!
Charles de La-Hirè—no! no!—I had refused thee
yesterday, hadst thou been willing to redeem me, by
self-sacrifice, <span class='it'>then</span> from the convent walls!—I had
refused thee <span class='it'>then</span>, with love warming my heart toward
thee—in all honor! Force me not to reject
thee <span class='it'>now</span> with scorn and hatred. Nor dare to think
that Marguerite de Vaudreuil will owe to man’s
compassion, what she owes not to love! Peace!
Charles de La-Hirè—I say, peace! my last words to
thee have been spoken, and never will I hear more
from thee! And now, Sir King, hear thou—may God
judge between thee and me, as thou hast judged. If
I <span class='it'>was</span> frail and fickle, nature and God made woman
weak and credulous—but made man <span class='it'>not</span> wise, to deceive
and ruin her. If I sinned deeply against this
Baron De La-Hirè—I sinned not knowingly, nor of
premeditation! If I sinned deeply, more deeply was
I sinned against—more deeply was I left to suffer!—even
hadst thou heaped no more brands upon the
burning. If to bear hopeless love—to pine with
unavailing sorrow—to repent with continual remorse—to
writhe with trampled pride!—if these things be
to suffer, then, Sir King, had I enough suffered without
thy <span class='it'>just</span> interposition!” As she spoke, a bitter
sneer curled her lip for a moment; but as she saw
Henry again about to speak, a wilder and higher
expression flashed over all her features—her form
appeared to distend—her bosom heaved—her eye
glared—her ringlets seemed to stiffen, as if instinct
with life “Nay!” she cried, in a voice clear as the
strain of a silver trumpet—“nay! thou <span class='it'>shalt</span> hear
me out—and thou didst swear yesterday I should live
in a cloister cell forever!—and I replied to thy words
<span class='it'>then</span>, ‘not long!’—I have thought better <span class='it'>now</span>—and <span class='it'>now</span>
I answer ‘<span class='it'>never</span>!’ Lo here!—lo here! ye who have
marked the doom of Armand—mark now the doom of
Marguerite! Ye who have judged the treason, mark
the doom of the traitress!” And with the words, before
any one could interfere, even had they suspected
her intentions, she raised her right hand on high, and
all then saw the quick twinkle of a weapon, and
struck herself, as it seemed, a quick slight blow
immediately under the left bosom! It seemed a
quick slight blow! but it had been so accurately
studied—so steadily aimed and fatally—that the keen
blade, scarcely three inches long and very slender, of
the best of Milan steel, with nearly a third of the
hilt, was driven home into her very heart—she spoke
no syllable again!—nor uttered any cry!—nor did a
single spasm contract her pallid features, a single
convulsion distort her shapely limbs! but she
leaped forward, and fell upon her face, quite dead,
at the King’s feet!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry smiled not again for many a day thereafter—Charles
De La Hirè died very old, a Carthusian
monk of the strictest order, having mourned sixty
years and prayed in silence for the sorrows and the
sins of that most hapless being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A solitary hearse without mourner or friend wheeled by me with unceremonious speed. It filled my heart with feelings
of the most chilling desolation, which were augmented perhaps by the peculiar gloom of the evening. I reached the
rude grave in which the corpse was deposited, and learned from the menial who was performing the last rites that it was
a young German of fine talents, with whom I had travelled a few months before, who, far from his home and friends,
had fallen a victim to the prevailing epidemic.—<span class='sc'>Letter of a Friend.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Well</span> met, Harry,” exclaimed Edward Morton,
as he encountered his friend Wilford in Broadway,
“I have two questions to ask you. In the first place,
what do you call that odd-looking vehicle in which
I saw you riding yesterday? and in the second, who
was that pretty little sister Ruth seated so demurely
beside you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My new carriage,” said Harry, laughing, “having
been invented by myself, has the honor to bear
my name; it is called a Wilford; I will sell it to you
cheap, if you like it, for that booby Danforth has
ordered one of the same pattern, and I will never
sport mine after he comes out with his.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so because a fool follows your lead you
throw up your cards; you will have enough to do if
you carry out that rule in all your actions. Thank
you for your kind offer; but really I am neither rich
nor fashionable enough to drive about town in such
a Welsh butter-tub. Now, answer my second question;
who is the lady;—has she been named in honor
of the vehicle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but she will probably bear the name of its
inventor in due time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can it be possible, Harry? have you really determined
to turn Benedict before the pleasures of freedom
have palled upon your taste? Have you seriously
reflected upon all you are about to relinquish? Have
you thought upon the pleasant <span class='it'>tête-à-têtes</span>, the agreeable
flirtations, the many delicious ‘love-passages’
which the admired Harry Wilford is privileged to
enjoy while he roves at large, but which will hereafter
be denied to him who wears the clanking fetters
of matrimony?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have thought of every thing, Ned; and, to tell
you the truth, I am beginning to get tired of the aimless,
profitless life I now lead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, therefore, you are going to turn merchant
and marry; you will have a considerable amount to
add to profit and loss by these experiments. Pray
who is the enchantress that has woven so wondrous
a spell of transformation?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She bears the primitive name of Rachel, and was
both born and bred in the little village of Westbury,
where, as I am told, a fashionably cut coat or one
of Leary’s hats would be regarded as a foreign curiosity.
She has never stirred beyond the precincts of
her native place until this spring, when she accompanied
a newly married relative to our gay city. Indeed
she has been kept so strictly within the pale of
her society, that if her cousin had not fortunately
married out of it, the lovely Rachel would probably
have walked quietly to meeting with some grave
young broad-brim, and contented herself with a drab
bonnet all her life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So your inamorata is country bred. By Jupiter
I shall begin to believe in the revival of witchcraft.
Is she rich, Harry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see the drift of your question, Ned; but you
are mistaken if you think I have looked on her
through golden spectacles. She is an orphan with
sufficient property to render her independent of
relatives, but not enough to entice a fortune-hunter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if any one but yourself had told me that
Harry Wilford, with all his advantages of <span class='it'>purse</span> and
<span class='it'>person</span>, had made choice of a little rusticated Quakeress
to be his bride, I could not have believed it,”
said Morton; “pray do you expect this pretty Lady
Gravely to preside at the exquisite dinners for which
your bachelor’s establishment has long been famous?
or do you intend to forego such vulgar enjoyments
for the superior pleasures of playing Darby to Mrs.
Wilford’s Joan in your chimney corner?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No quizzing, Ned,” said Wilford, smiling,
“Rachel has been well educated, and the staid decorum
of the sect has not destroyed her native elegance
of manner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the <span class='it'>drab bonnet</span>, Harry:—can <span class='it'>you</span>, the pride
of your tailor and the envy of your less tasteful
friends,—<span class='it'>you</span>, the very prince of Broadway exquisites,—you,
the American Brummel, who would as
willingly have been caught picking a pocket, as
wearing a glove two days, a hat two weeks, or a
coat two months,—can you venture to destroy the
reputation which you have acquired at such cost, by
introducing a drab bonnet to the acquaintance of
your be-plumed and be-flowered female friends?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait awhile, Edward; Rachel has not yet
learned to admire the gayeties of our city; her eyes
have been too long accustomed to the ‘sober twilight
gray,’ and she is rather dazzled than pleased with
the splendor of fashionable society, but she has too
much of womanly feelings to continue long insensible
to womanly vanity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, success to you, Harry, but let me beg you
to lay an interdict on that ugly bonnet as soon as
you have a right to exercise your marital authority.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wilford laughed, and the two gentlemen parted;
the one to fulfil an engagement with the pretty
Quakeress, and the other to smoke a cigar, drink a
mint julep, and laugh at his friend’s folly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry Wilford had been so unlucky as to come
into possession of a large fortune as soon as he
attained his majority. I am not in error, gentle
reader, when I say he was <span class='it'>unlucky</span>, for daily experience
bears witness to the fact, that in this country,
at least in nine cases out of ten, a large inheritance
is a great misfortune. The records of gay life in
every large city prove that the most useless, most
ignorant, most vicious, and often the most degraded
among the youth, are usually the sons of plodding
and hoarding parents, who have pawned health and
happiness, aye, and sometimes <span class='it'>integrity</span>—the very
life of the soul—to procure the gold which brings
the destruction of their children. Wilford had
passed through college with the reputation of being
one of the most gifted and most indolent of scholars,
while his eccentric fits of study, which served to
give him the highest rank in his class, only showed
how much more he might have done, if industry and
perseverance had been allowed to direct his pursuits.
Like his career in the university had been his course
through life. With much latent energy of character
he was too infirm of purpose to become distinguished
either for virtue or talent. The curse of Ephraim
seemed to have fallen upon the child of prosperity,
and the impressive words of the ancient Patriarch:
“Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel,” might
have shadowed forth his destiny. His fine talents
were wasted in empty witticisms; his classical taste
only served to direct his lavish expenditure, and his
really noble feelings were frittered away in hollow
friendship, or in transitory attachments. Handsome,
brilliant, and, above all, rich, he became the idol of
a coterie, and intoxicated by the incense which
smoked before him, he did not perceive that its subtle
influence enervated all his nobler faculties. Yet Wilford
had escaped the contagion of vice. The dark
stain of criminal excess, which too often sullies the
cloth of gold more deeply than it does the coat of
frieze, had never fallen upon his garments. He could
not forget the trembling hand which had been laid
upon his infant head when he offered up his innocent
prayers at a mother’s knee. He remembered
her dying supplication that her child might be kept
“unspotted from the world,” and her gentle face,
beaming with unutterable purity and love, often
interposed itself between his and his tempter, when
his heart would have failed from very weakness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry Wilford had completed his thirtieth summer
and yet he was a bachelor. The artillery of
bright eyes and brighter smiles had been levelled at
him in vain; the gentler weapons of sweet words
and soft glances had been equally ineffectual. His
heart had been captured again and again, but it
was a far easier task to <span class='it'>gain</span> than to <span class='it'>keep</span> it. Indeed
it was like an ill-garrisoned border fortress, and
generally surrendered at discretion to the first enemy
that sat down before it, who was sure to be
soon driven out in turn by another victorious assailant.
He was too universal a lover, and until, like
Apelles, he could unite in one woman the charms
which he admired in twenty, there seemed little
probability of his ever being won to wear the chain.
The truth was, that of the many who courted the
attentions of the handsome Mr. Wilford, there was
none that seemed to have discovered the fine gold
which lay beneath the surface of his character. The
very exuberance of flowers and fruit which the soil
produced, prevented one from expecting any hidden
treasure, for it is not often that the precious things
of earth are found beneath its gay adornments. We
look for the diamond, not under the bank of violets
but in the rugged bosom of the mountain, and thus
Wilford’s friends, content with the beautiful blossoms
of fancy and wit which he lavishly flung around,
suspected not the noble gifts of intellect which he
possessed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wilford had frequently imagined himself in love,
but something had always occurred to undeceive him
and to resolve his pleasant fancies with very disagreeable
facts. He had learned that the demon of
selfishness often lurks under the form of an angel of
light, and he began to distrust many of the fair beings
who bestowed upon him their gentle smiles. He had
received more than one severe lesson in human
nature, and it was very soon after officiating as
groomsman at the bridal of a lovely girl whose faith
had once been pledged to him, that he first met the
young and guileless Quakeress. There was something
so pure and vestal-like in the delicate complexion,
soft blue eye, and simply braided hair of the
gentle Rachel, that Wilford was instantly charmed.
His eye, so long dazzled with the gorgeous draperies,
glittering jewels, and well-displayed beauties of
fashionable belles, rested with a sense of relief on
the sober French gray silk, and transparent lawn
neckerchief which so carefully shaded the charms
of the fair rustic. He saw the prettiest of tiny feet
peeping from beneath a robe of far more decorous
length than the laws of fashion then allowed—the
whitest of white hands were unadorned by a single
jewel—and the most snowy of necks was only discovered
by the swan-like grace which rendered it
visible above its envious screen of muslin. Even in
the society of Friends, where a beautiful complexion
is almost as common to the females as a pair of eyes
to each face, Rachel was remarkable for the peculiar
delicacy of hers. It was not of that waxy, creamy
tint, so often considered the true fashionable and
aristocratic complexion, because supposed to be an
evidence that the “winds of heaven” have never
visited the face except through the blinds of a carriage;
nor was it the flake-white and carmine-red
which often claims for its possessor the reputation of
a brilliant tincture of the skin. Even the old and
worn-out similes of the lily and the rose, would have
failed to give an idea of the delicate hues which
added such a charm to Rachel’s countenance, for the
changing glow of her soft cheek, and the tracery of
blue veins which adorned her snowy brow could
never be imaged by a flower of the field. Harry
Wilford thought he had never seen anything so
exquisitely lovely, so purely fair, as that sweet face
when in perfect repose, or so vividly bright as it
seemed when lighted by the blush of modesty. There
are some faces which require shadows to perfect
their beauty; the eye, though bright, must flash
beneath jetty lashes; the brow, though white, must
gleam amid raven tresses or half the effect is lost.
But Rachel’s face, like that of joyous childhood, was
all light. Her hair was silky and soft as an infant’s,
her eyes blue as the summer heaven, her lips like an
opening rose-bud—it was a face like spring sunshine,
all brightness and all beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rachel had been left an orphan in her infancy, and
the relatives to whom she was indebted for her
early nurture were among the straitest of a strait
sect, consequently she had imbibed their rigid ideas
of dress and manners. Indeed she had never wasted
a thought upon the pomps and vanities of the ‘world’s
people,’ until she visited the gay metropolis. The
sneers which her plain dress occasioned in the circle
where she now moved, and the merry jibes which
young and thoughtless companions cast upon her
peculiar tenets of faith, aroused all the latent pride
of her nature, until she actually felt a degree of
triumph in exhibiting her quaint costume in society.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Wilford had been charmed with her beauty, he
was in raptures with her unsophisticated character.
After ringing the changes on <span class='it'>sentiment</span> until his feelings
were ‘like sweet bells jangled out of tune,’ it
was absolutely refreshing to find a damsel who had
never hung enraptured over the passionate pages of
Byron, nor breathed the voluptuous songs of Moore,
but who, in the simplicity of her heart, admired and
quoted the gentle Cowper, as the prince of poets.
“She has much to learn in the heart’s lore,” said
Wilford to himself, “and what pleasure it will be to
develop her innocent affections.” So he offered his
hand to the pretty Quakeress, and she, little versed in
the arts of coquetry, modestly accepted the gift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One morning Rachel sat by the window, looking
out upon the gay throng in Broadway, when her
cousin entered with a small packet in her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is something for you, Rachel, a love token
I suppose,” said Mrs. Hadley. Rachel blushed as
she opened the envelope, but her color deepened to
an almost angry hue when she unclosed a morocco
box, and beheld an exquisite set of pearls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beautiful!” exclaimed Mrs. Hadley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall not keep them,” said Rachel quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not keep them! pray why?” asked her cousin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I should never wear them, and because
Mr. Wilford has not kept his word with me. He
promised never to interfere with what he called my
style of dress, and I told him I would never lay aside
my plain costume, though I was willing to modify it
a little for his sake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here he comes to answer for himself,” said Mrs.
Hadley as Wilford entered. “You are just in time,”
she continued, “for Rachel is very angry with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rachel could not repress a feeling of pride and
pleasure as she looked on the graceful form of her
lover, who, taking a seat beside her, whispered, “Are
you indeed displeased with me, dearest? Pray what
is my offence?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She replied by placing in his hand the box of
pearls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you then reject so simple an offering of affection,
Rachel?” said Harry, “you should regard
these gems not as the vain ornaments of fashion, but
as the most delicate and beautiful productions of
the wonderful world of ocean. Look, can any thing
be more emblematical of purity?” and as he spoke he
placed a pearl rose upon the soft golden hair which
was folded above her white forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rachel did look, and, as the large mirror reflected
her beautiful face, she was conscious of an impulse,
(almost her very first) of womanly vanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot wear them, Harry,” said she, “necklace
and bracelets would be very useless to one who
never unveils either neck or arms, and such costly
head-gear would be ill suited to my plain silk dress,
and lawn cape.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wilford had too much tact to press the subject.
The box was consigned to his pocket, and the offence
was forgiven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Ce n’est que le premier pas qui coute</span>,” said he,
as he walked home, “my fifteen hundred dollars has
been thrown away for the present; I must proceed
more cautiously in my work of reform.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morning fixed for the marriage at length
arrived. Rachel was in her apartment, surrounded
by her friends, and had just commenced her toilet,
when a small parcel, accompanied by a delicate
rose-colored note, was placed in her hands. She,
of course, opened the note first; it was as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive me, my sweet Rachel, if on this morning
I venture to suggest a single addition to your simple
dress. There are always idle persons standing about
the church door on such an occasion as a wedding,
and I am foolish enough to be unwilling that the careless
eye of every indifferent spectator should scan the
exquisite beauty of your face to-day. There is
something extremely painful to me in the thought
that the blushing cheek of my fair bride should be
the subject of cold remark. Will you not, for my
sake, dearest, veil the rich treasure of your loveliness
for one brief hour? I know I am selfish in making
the request, but for once forgive my jealousy, and
shade your brightness from the stranger’s gaze.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The parcel contained a Brussels lace veil of surpassing
richness, so delicate in its texture, so magnificent
in its pattern that Rachel could not repress an
exclamation of pleasure at the sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her toilet was at length completed. A dress of
plain white satin, finished at the neck by a chemisette
of simple lace, her hair folded plainly around her
small head and plaited in a single braid behind:—such
was the bridal attire of the rigid little Quakeress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the veil, Rachel,” whispered her cousin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, rather than shock Harry’s delicacy,” said
she, half smiling, “I believe I will wear it, but I
shall look very ridiculous in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The veil fell in rich folds nearly to her feet, and
nothing could be imagined more beautiful than her
whole appearance in this plain but magnificent costume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You want a pearl comb, or something of the
kind, to fasten this veil properly,” said one of the
bridesmaids.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a pity you had not kept the box,” whispered
her cousin. Rachel smiled as she replied,
“if I had ever dreamed of wearing such an unusual
appendage as this perhaps I might have retained the
rose at least.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rachel had taken the <span class='it'>first</span> step when she consented
to adopt the veil, the second would have cost her less
trouble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately after the ceremony, Mr. and Mrs.
Wilford set off for the Springs. A servant had preceded
them with their baggage, and Rachel soon
found herself in the midst of a more brilliant circle
than she had yet seen. The day after their arrival
she was preparing for a ride, and a crowd had collected
on the piazza to admire Wilford’s elegant
equipage and fine blood-horses. But an unforeseen
annoyance had occurred to disturb the bride’s feelings.
Attired in a dress of dark lavender-colored
silk, she folded her white cashmere around her
shoulders, and opened the band-box which contained
her bridal hat. This had only been sent home on the
morning of her marriage, and having been instantly
forwarded with the other baggage, she had not yet
seen it. How was she startled therefore to find,
instead of the close cottage hat which she had ordered,
as the nearest possible approach to her Quaker
bonnet, a gay-looking French affair, trimmed with a
wreath of lilies of the valley. What was to be done?
it was impossible to procure another, and to despoil
the bonnet of its flowers gave it an unfinished and
slovenly appearance. Harry affected to condole with
her, and finally persuaded her to wear it rather than
expose herself to the charge of affectation by
assuming her travelling calash.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Ce n’est que le premier pas qui coute</span>,” said he,
to himself, as he saw the blush mantle her lovely
cheek when she contemplated her reflection in the
mirror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What shall I do?” exclaimed Rachel, “it does
not half cover my head; I never wore such a flaunting,
flaring thing in my life: I wish I had my veil,
for I am actually ashamed of myself: ah, here it is,
coz must have put it into the box, and I dare say it
is she who has played me this trick about my bonnet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, throwing on her splendid veil to hide her unwonted
finery, Rachel took her husband’s arm and
entered the carriage, leaving the gentlemen to admire
her beauty and the ladies to talk about her magnificent
Brussels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Six months after her marriage Mrs. Wilford was
dressing for a party; Monsieur Frisette had arranged
her beautiful hair in superb ringlets and braids, and
was just completing his task when the maid accidentally
removing her embroidered handkerchief
from the dressing-table discovered beneath it the box
of pearls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah voilà Madame, de very ting—dat leetle rose
vill just do for fix dese curl,” said Monsieur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she continued her toilet she found that Madame
M*** had trimmed the corsage of her dress in such
a manner as to preclude the possibility of wearing
either cape or scarf according to her usual habit.
She could not appear with her neck quite bare, and
nothing remained but to cover it with the massy
medallions of her pearl necklace. In short, when
fully dressed for the party, some good reason had
been found for adopting every ornament which the
box contained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just as I expected,” said Wilford, mentally, as
he conducted her to the carriage, “Rachel has taken
the <span class='it'>first step</span>, she will never put on the drab bonnet
again.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three years after the events just recorded, the
fatal red flag of the auctioneer was seen projecting
from one of the upper windows of a stately house,
and crowds of the idle, the curious, and the speculating
were entering the open door. It was the residence
of Harry Wilford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, how things will turn out,” said a fat,
frowsy dame, as she seated herself on a velvet sofa
and drew a chair in front of her to keep off the
throng, “sit down Charlotte,” continued she, addressing
a newly married niece, “sit down and let
us make ourselves comfortable until the auctioneer
has done selling the kitchen furniture. Only think—the
last time I was here before Mrs. Wilford had a
great party, and the young folks all came in fancy
dresses, and I sat on this very sofa. That is only
three months ago, and now everything has gone to
rack and ruin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did it all happen?” asked a pleasant-looking
woman who stood near.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mrs. Wilford was awfully extravagant, and
her husband thought there was no bounds to his
riches, so they lived too fast; ‘burnt their candle at
both ends,’ as the saying is. They say Mrs. Wilford
hurried on her husband’s ruin, for he had been speculating
too deeply, and was in debt, but his creditors
would have waited if she had not given that last
dashing party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know that fact!” asked the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, from the best authority, my husband is one
of the principal creditors,” replied the dame with a
look of dignity, “he told me the whole story as we
were going to the party, and declared that he would
not stand such dishonest dealings, so the very next
morning he was down upon Mr. Wilford, and before
twelve o’clock he had compelled him to make an
assignment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it was among such people—men and women
who would sit at the hospitable board with murder
in their hearts—who would share in the festivities
of a household even while meditating the destruction
of that pleasant home—it was among such as
these that Wilford had lived—it was for such as
these that he had striven to change the simple habits
and artless manners of his true-hearted Rachel. It
was the dread laugh of such as these which had led
him to waste her energies as well as his own in the
pursuit of fashion and folly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wilford had succeeded even beyond his intentions
in imbuing his gentle bride with a love for worldly
vanities. His wishes delicately but earnestly expressed,
together with the new-born vanity which
her unwonted adornments engendered in the bosom
of Rachel, gradually overcame her early habits.
One by one the insignia of her simple faith were
thrown aside. Her beautiful neck was unveiled to
the admiring eye—her ungraceful sleeve receded
until the rounded arm was visible in its full proportions—the
skirt, following the laws of fashion, lost
several degrees of longitude, until the beauty of Mrs.
Wilford’s foot was no longer a disputable fact. In
short, in little more than two years after her marriage,
her wealth, her beauty, her elegance of manners,
and her costly dress made her decidedly a leader
of ton. Wilford could not but regret the change.
She was ever affectionate and devoted to him with
all the earnestness of womanly tenderness, but he
was ashamed to tell her that in obeying his wishes
she had actually gone beyond them. He hoped that
it was only the novelty of her position which had
thus fascinated her, and yet he often found himself
regretting that he had ever exposed her to such
temptations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But new and unlooked-for trials were in store for
both. The estate of Mr. Wilford had always been
managed by his uncle, a careful merchant, who,
through the course of his whole life, had seemed to
possess the Midas-like faculty of converting every
thing he touched into gold; and satisfied that, as he
was the old man’s only heir, the property would be
carefully husbanded, Wilford gave himself no trouble
about the matter. But the mania for real estate speculation
had now infected the whole nation. The old
gentleman found himself the ridiculed of many a
bold spirit who had dashed into the stream and
gathered the gold dust which it bore along; he had
long withstood the sneers of those who considered
themselves wise in their generation, because they
were pursuing a gambling scheme of wealth; but at
length he could no longer resist the influence! He
obtained the concurrence of his nephew, and thus
furnished with double means struck boldly out from
the safe haven where he had been ensconced. Every
thing went on swimmingly for a time; his gains
were immense—<span class='it'>upon paper</span>, but the tide turned, and
the result was total wreck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was long ere Wilford became aware of his misfortunes.
Accustomed to rely implicitly on his
uncle’s judgment, he reposed in indolent security
until the tidings of the old man’s bankruptcy and his
own consequent ruin came upon him like a thunderbolt.
He had been too long the child of prosperity
to bear reverses with fortitude. He had no profession,
no knowledge of business, nothing by which
he could obtain a future livelihood; and now, when
habits of luxury had enervated both mind and body,
he found himself utterly beggared. He brooded over
his losses in moody bitterness of spirit long before
the world became acquainted with his situation. He
even concealed them from his wife, from that mistaken
and cruel kindness which thinks to lighten the
blow by keeping it long suspended. “How can I
overwhelm her with sorrow and mortification by
telling her we are beggars?” he cried, in anguish.
“How can I bid her descend from the lofty eminence
of wealth and fashion and retire to obscurity and
seclusion? How can I be sure that she will bear
the tidings with a patient spirit? I have sown within
her young heart the seeds of vanity, and how can I
hope to eradicate now the evils which have sprang
from them? Her own little fortune is all that is now
left, and how we are to live on that I cannot tell.
Rachel cannot bear it—I know she cannot!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His thoughts added new anguish to his regrets,
and months of harrowing dread and anxiety passed
away before Wilford could summon courage to face
manfully his increasing misfortunes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Wilford had long intended to celebrate her
husband’s birth-day by a brilliant party, and, quite
unconscious of the storm which impended over her,
she issued her cards nearly a month previous to the
appointed evening. Harry Wilford knew that the
party ought not to be given; he knew that it would
bring discredit upon him, and perhaps censure upon
his wife, for he was conscious that his affairs were
rapidly approaching a fatal crisis; but he had not
courage to own the truth. He watched the preparations
for the party with a boding spirit; he looked
sadly and fondly upon the brilliant attire of his young
wife as she glided about the gorgeous apartments,
and he felt that he was taking his last glance at happiness
and comfort. The very next day his principal
creditor, a fat, oily-faced, well-fed individual,
remarkable for the regularity of his attendance, and
the loudness of his responses at church—a man
whose piety was carried to such lengths that in the
fear lest his left hand should know the good which
his right hand did, he was particularly careful never
to do <span class='it'>any</span>—a man who would sit first at a feast and
store up the careless sayings of convivial frankness
to serve his own interest in the mart and the market-place—this
man, after pledging him in the wine-cup
and parting from him with the cordial grasp of
friendship, met him with a legal demand for that
which he knew would ruin him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fatal tidings could no longer be withheld from
Mrs. Wilford, and she was roused from the languor
which the fatigue of the preceding evening had left
both on mind and body, by the tidings of her husband’s
misfortunes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is as I feared,” thought Wilford, as he observed
her overwhelming emotion, “she cannot bear
the degradation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he was mistaken. There is a hidden strength
of character which can only be developed by the
stroke of calamity, and such was possessed by
Rachel Wilford. A moment, and but a moment, she
faltered; then she was prepared to brave the worst
evils of her altered fortunes. Wilford soon found
that she had both mind to comprehend and judgment
to counsel. Ere the morrow had passed half his
sorrow was assuaged, for he had found comfort and
even hope in the bosom of his young and devoted
wife. There was only one thing over which she
still deeply grieved, and this was her fatal party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had you only confided in me, Harry,” said she,
“worlds would not have tempted me to place you
and myself in so dishonorable a light. How could
you see me so unconscious of danger and treading
so heedlessly on the verge of ruin without withdrawing
me from it? Your own good name, Harry,
aye, and <span class='it'>mine</span> too, have suffered. Our integrity has
been doubted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did it for the best, Rachel; I would have spared
you as long as possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was most ill-judged kindness, Harry; it has
ruined you and deeply injured me. Believe me, a
wife is infinitely happier in the consciousness that
she possesses her husband’s confidence, than in the
discovery that she has been treated like a petted
child; a being of powers too limited to understand
his affairs or to be admitted to his councils.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Wilford did not merely meet her reverses
with fortitude. She was resolved to act as became
a high-minded woman. Her jewels were immediately
disposed of, not stealthily, and as if she
dreaded exposure, but by going openly to the persons
from whom they were purchased; and thus
realizing at least two-thirds of their original cost.
This sum she immediately appropriated to the payment
of household debts; and with it she satisfied
the claims of all those who had supplied them with
daily comforts. “I could not rest,” she said, “if I
felt there was one person living who might say I
wronged him out of the very bread I have eaten.”
The furniture was next given up—nothing was reserved—not
even the plate presented by her own
friends, nor the work-box, the gift of Harry. Lodgings
quiet and respectable but plain and cheap were
taken in a private boarding-house. Every vestige
of their former splendor was gone, and when all was
over, it was with a feeling of relief that the husband
and wife sat down together to form plans for the
future. The past seemed like a troubled dream.
Scarcely six months had elapsed since their stately
mansion had been the scene of joyous festivity, and
the very suddenness with which distress had come
seemed to have paralysed their sense of suffering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I received a proposal to-day, Rachel, which I
would not accept without consulting you,” said
Harry, as they sat together in their neatly furnished
apartment. “Edward Morton offers me the situation
of book-keeper, with a salary of a thousand dollars
per annum.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take it, by all means, dear Harry,” said his
wife, “constant employment will make you forget
your troubles, and a thousand dollars,” added she,
with a bright smile, “will be a fortune to us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose I had better accept his offer,” said
Wilford, gloomily, “but it cuts down a man’s pride to
be reduced to the condition of a hireling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not make me ashamed of my husband, dear
Harry,” was the earnest reply, “do not suffer me to
blush for the weakness and false pride which can
think only of external show. We can live very
comfortably on your salary, especially when we
have the consciousness of integrity to sweeten our
privations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You forget that you are not quite so much a beggar
as your husband, Rachel. The interest of your
twenty thousand dollars, added to my salary, will give
us something more than the mere comforts of life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean, Harry?” asked his wife,
turning very pale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why you do not suppose I was scoundrel enough
to risk your little property, Rachel; that was secured
you by a marriage settlement, and no creditor can
touch it unless you should assign it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rachel made no reply but fell into a long fit of
musing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was but a few days after this conversation that
Wilford, conquering his false pride, entered upon his
duties in the counting-room of his old friend Morton.
He returned early in the evening, wearied, sad, and
dispirited, but his wife met him with a face so bright
that he almost forgot the annoyances of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How happy you look, Rachel,” said he, as she
drew her chair beside his and laid her hand upon
his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am indeed happy, dear Harry, for I am now
no richer than yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t understand you,” replied Wilford with
a puzzled look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You gave me a most unpleasant piece of news
yesterday, Harry, when you told me that my paltry
little fortune had been preserved from your creditors,
and now I am happy in the consciousness that no
such reproach can attach to us. I have been closeted
with your lawyer this morning; he told me about
twenty thousand dollars would clear off all claims
against you, and by this time I suppose you are free.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have you done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Handed over my marriage settlement to your
assignees, Harry”—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And reduced yourself to a bare subsistence,
Rachel, to satisfy a group of gaping creditors who
would swallow my last morsel if they knew I was
left to starve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The debts were justly due, Harry, and I would
rather that the charge of illiberality should attach to
them than of dishonesty to us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have never known the evils of poverty, my
poor child,” said Wilford, despondingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor do I mean to experience them now, dear
husband; you will not let me want for comforts, and
you seem to forget that, though you have tried to spoil
me, my early habits were those of economy and
frugality.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you mean to adopt your simple Quaker habits
again, Rachel,” said Wilford, more cheerfully; “will
they include the drab bonnet also?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” returned the young wife, her face dimpled
with joyous smiles, “I believe now that as much
vanity lurked under my plain bonnet as ever sported
on the wave of a jewelled plume; and yet,” said
she, after a moment’s pause, “when I threw off my
Quaker garb I took my first step in error, for I can
trace all my folly, and extravagance, and waste of
time to the moment when I first looked with pleasure
in that little mirror at Saratoga.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well, dearest, your first step has not led
you so far astray but that you have been able most
nobly to retrace your path. I am poorer than I ever
expected to be, yet richer than I could ever have
hoped, for had I never experienced a reverse of fortune,
I should never have learned the worth of my
own sweet wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry Wilford was right, and the felicity which
he now enjoys in his own quiet and cheerful home—a
home won by his own industry and diligence—is
well worth all the price at which it was purchased,
even though it cost him his whole estate.</p>

<p class='line0'>As if, in all her frenzy, she would leap</p>
<p class='line0'>The cursed barrier: forward, fast and fast⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Back, back she reels; her timbers and her mast</p>

<p class='line0'>Of his strong hands grew weak,—a giant shower</p>
<p class='line0'>Of foam rose up, and swept him far along;</p>
<p class='line0'>And Julio saw him buffetting the throng</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Then terribly he laugh’d, and rose above</p>

<p class='line0'>Lifting him up in all his wizard glee;</p>
<p class='line0'>And he did wave, before the frantic sea,</p>

<p class='line0'>Like him, I sweep thee with a storm</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Of music and of joy!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And Julio placed the trembling harp before</p>
<p class='line0'>The ladye; till the minstrel winds came o’er</p>
<p class='line0'>Its moisten’d strings, and tuned them with a sigh.</p>
<p class='line0'>“I hear thee, how thy spirit goeth by,</p>
<p class='line0'>In music and in love. Oh, Agathè!</p>
<p class='line0'>Thou sleepest long, long, long; and they will say</p>
<p class='line0'>That seek thee,—‘she is dead—she is no more!’</p>
<p class='line0'>But thou art cold, and I will throw before</p>
<p class='line0'>Thy chilly brow the pale and snowy sheet.”</p>
<p class='line0'>And he did lift it from her marble feet,</p>
<p class='line0'>The sea-wet shroud! and flung it silently</p>
<p class='line0'>Over her brow—the brow of Agathè!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>But, as a passion from the mooded mind,</p>
<p class='line0'>The storm had died, and wearily the wind</p>
<p class='line0'>Fell fast asleep at evening, like one</p>
<p class='line0'>That hath been toiling in the fiery sun.</p>
<p class='line0'>And the white sail dropt downward, as the wing</p>
<p class='line0'>Of wounded sea-bird, feebly murmuring</p>
<p class='line0'>Unto the mast—it was a deathly calm,</p>
<p class='line0'>And holy stillness, like a shadow, swam</p>
<p class='line0'>All over the wide sea, and the boat stood,</p>
<p class='line0'>Like her of Sodom, in the solitude,</p>
<p class='line0'>A snowy pillow, looking on the waste.</p>
<p class='line0'>And there was nothing but the azure breast</p>
<p class='line0'>Of ocean and the sky—the sea and sky.</p>
<p class='line0'>And the lone bark; no clouds were floating by</p>
<p class='line0'>Where the sun set, but his great seraph light,</p>
<p class='line0'>Went down alone, in majesty and might;</p>
<p class='line0'>And the stars came again, a silver troop,</p>
<p class='line0'>Until, in shame, the coward shadows droop</p>
<p class='line0'>Before the radiance of these holy gems,</p>
<p class='line0'>That bear the images of diadems!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And Julio fancied of a form that rose</p>
<p class='line0'>Before him from the desolate repose</p>
<p class='line0'>Of the deep waters—a huge ghastly form,</p>
<p class='line0'>As of one lightning-stricken in a storm;</p>
<p class='line0'>And leprosy cadaverous was hung</p>
<p class='line0'>Before his brow, and awful terror flung</p>
<p class='line0'>Around him like a pall—a solemn shroud!⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>A drapery of darkness and of cloud!</p>
<p class='line0'>And agony was writhing on his lip,</p>
<p class='line0'>Heart-rooted, awful agony and deep,</p>
<p class='line0'>Of fevers, and of plagues, and burning blain,</p>
<p class='line0'>And ague, and the palsy of the brain—</p>
<p class='line0'>A weird and yellow spectre! and his eyes</p>
<p class='line0'>Were orbless and unpupil’d, as the skies</p>
<p class='line0'>Without the sun, or moon, or any star:</p>
<p class='line0'>And he was like the wreck of what men are,⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>A wasted skeleton, that held the crest</p>
<p class='line0'>Of time, and bore his motto on his breast!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>There came a group before of maladies,</p>
<p class='line0'>And griefs, and Famine empty as a breeze,⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>A double monster, with a gloating leer</p>
<p class='line0'>Fix’d on his other half. They drew them near,</p>
<p class='line0'>One after one, led onward by Despair,</p>
<p class='line0'>That like the last of winter glimmer’d there,⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>A dismal prologue to his brother Death,</p>
<p class='line0'>Which was behind; and, with the horrid breath</p>
<p class='line0'>Of his wide baneful nostrils, plied them on.</p>
<p class='line0'>And often as they saw the skeleton</p>
<p class='line0'>Grisly beside them, the wild phantasies</p>
<p class='line0'>Grew mad and howl’d; the fever of disease</p>
<p class='line0'>Became wild frenzy—very terrible!</p>
<p class='line0'>And, for a hell of agony—a hell</p>
<p class='line0'>Of rage, was there, that fed on misty things,</p>
<p class='line0'>On dreams, ideas, and imaginings.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And some were raving on philosophy,</p>
<p class='line0'>And some on love, and some on jealousy,</p>
<p class='line0'>And some upon the moon, and these were they</p>
<p class='line0'>That were the wildest; and anon alway</p>
<p class='line0'>Julio knew them by a something dim</p>
<p class='line0'>About their wasted features like to him!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>But Death was by, like shell of pyramid</p>
<p class='line0'>Among old obelisks, and his eyeless head</p>
<p class='line0'>Shook o’er the wry ribs, where darkness lay</p>
<p class='line0'>The image of a heart—she is away!</p>
<p class='line0'>And Julio is watching, like Remorse,</p>
<p class='line0'>Over the pale and solitary corse.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Shower soft light, ye stars, that shake the dew</p>
<p class='line0'>From your eternal blossoms! and thou, too,</p>

<p class='line0'>That hast a slave and votary within</p>
<p class='line0'>The great rock-fetter’d deep, and hearest cry</p>
<p class='line0'>To thee the hungry surges, rushing by</p>
<p class='line0'>Like a vast herd of wolves,—fall full and fair</p>
<p class='line0'>On Julio as he sleepeth, even there,</p>
<p class='line0'>Amid the suppliant bosom of the sea!⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Sleep! dost thou come, and on thy blessed knee</p>
<p class='line0'>With hush and whisper lull the troubled brain</p>
<p class='line0'>Of this death-lover?—still the eyes do strain</p>
<p class='line0'>Their orbs on Agathè—those raven eyes!</p>
<p class='line0'>All earnest on the ladye as she lies</p>
<p class='line0'>In her white shroud. They see not, though they are</p>
<p class='line0'>As if they saw; no splendour like a star</p>
<p class='line0'>Is under their dark lashes: they are full</p>
<p class='line0'>Of dream and slumber—melancholy, dull!</p>

<p class='line0'>Woke up, and saw them flashing fiercely by.</p>

<p class='line0'>When Julio is watching Agathè!</p>
<p class='line0'>By sun and darkness hath he bent him over⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>A mad, moon-stricken, melancholy lover!</p>
<p class='line0'>And hardly hath he tasted, night or day,</p>
<p class='line0'>Of drink or food, because of Agathè!</p>
<p class='line0'>He sitteth in a dull and dreary mood,</p>

<p class='line0'>Of her bright soul. These are not as they were;</p>
<p class='line0'>But are as weeds above a sepulchre,</p>
<p class='line0'>Wild waving in the breeze: her eyes are now</p>
<p class='line0'>Sunk deeply under the discolor’d brow,</p>
<p class='line0'>That is of sickly yellow, and pale blue</p>
<p class='line0'>Unnaturally blending. The same hue</p>
<p class='line0'>Is on her cheek. It is the early breath</p>
<p class='line0'>Of cold corruption, the ban-dog of death,</p>
<p class='line0'>Falling upon her features. Let it be,</p>

<p class='line0'>A very cloud was cast upon their light,</p>
<p class='line0'>That gave to them the heavy hue of lead;</p>

<p class='line0'>Of aged pines, all leafless but their brows,</p>
<p class='line0'>Where a green group of tempest-stricken boughs</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>I was</span> wandering in the streets of a populous city—thousands
crowded the thronged thoroughfares—jarring
and jostling along,—each intent on his own
petty schemes. Here, a merchant rushed onward
with a rapid step—for it wanted but five minutes of
three o’clock! If clouds had overspread his countenance
an hour before, they had given place to a
determined expression, that seemed to say, “safe
till to-morrow, anyhow!” There, a belle flaunted
in costly attire, with a curl on her lip and pride in
her tread that spoke, more plainly than words, “conquest
is my right! for my beauty and wealth are
alike undisputed, I have but to smile and win!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At one moment, my eye was attracted by a young
couple in the spring-tide of their promise, associated
by that magic feeling which comes over us but once
in a life-time. At the next, it rested on a pair of
unfortunates with locked arms but gloomy brows
and half averted faces, convinced, by twenty years
of bitter experience, that <span class='it'>it is wise to preserve appearances</span>,
even when doing penance for that most common,
but most fatal indiscretion of youth—an ill-assorted
marriage!</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little girl, upon the door-step of an elegant mansion,
stood gazing upon the passing crowd and the
unbroken line of splendid equipages hurrying by,
glancing her eye occasionally upward at the tall trees
that shielded her from the sunshine, or the bright
blue sky and fleecy vapor which seemed to rest upon
their summits. The breezes of May waved the translucent
ringlets athwart her snowy shoulders, while
the leaves danced and rustled mirthfully in the wind,
and a little bird, upon a neighboring bough, poured
out its joyous song! The child threw back her head
and laughed long and merrily: yet there was nothing
in view to awaken laughter!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Guarded, and clad,—and nourished,—and incognisant
of care,—the bounding pulse of youth felt keenly
in every fibre,—existence itself, with her, became
delight! and she laughed in the fulness of irrepressible
joy—<span class='it'>that the skies were bright and the leaves were
green!</span>—On the pavement beside her, a barefoot and
ragged boy leaned for support against a post. Famine
and fatigue were legibly stampt upon his sunken
cheek and attenuated limbs. The sound of merriment
awakened him, and he turned his dull eye in
wonder upon the beautiful object before him!—But
he comprehended it not!—joy was to him a
stranger!</p>

<p class='pindent'>These, and a hundred other episodes in the selfish
history of common life claimed, in turn, my attention;—and
each might have furnished subject matter
for a month of thought or a volume of moral deduction.
But there was one group so peculiarly striking
that it still dwells upon my memory with more
than usual vividness of coloring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the most luxurious portion of the city, where
palaces of marble and granite rose on every hand,
and the very air was redolent of the incense of
exotic flowers, a coach, dusty with travel, suddenly
drew up before one of the most conspicuous residences.
The liveried footman instantly threw open
the door, and a delicate young girl, with a highly
intellectual, but care-worn and sorrowful expression
of countenance, began to descend the steps. But,
before she could reach the pavement a masculine
arm was projected from the vehicle to arrest her
progress, and a voice, tremulous with age and grief,
exclaimed, “No! no! not here! not here!—Why
will you not take me home!—I must go home!—I am
old and sick!—Do take me home at once!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The attempt to draw the young lady back within
the coach endangered her foot-hold, and courtesy
obliged me to spring to her assistance, lest she
should fall beneath the wheels. Adroitly lifting her
from the carriage while the footman hastened to
ring the bell, I obtained a view of all the parties
interested in this little incident.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The half fainting girl, still leaning upon my arm,
might have numbered about fourteen summers, and
within the coach were two other individuals, in both
of whom the same family traits were visible. One
of these, a woman about thirty-five years of age,
was evidently the mother. She was still beautiful,
though strong traces of habitual thought and mental
suffering were perceptible upon her brow. The
other was a man of noble figure, probably advanced
to seventy years, with locks of snowy whiteness,
but dressed with a degree of richness and precision,
not usually observed among the old. It was evident
that he had been familiar with the world—that
wealth and luxury were no novelties to him. The
forms of society had been his study, if not the business
of his life. Yet, what a satire upon the vulgar
misconceptions of the means of happiness was the
aspect of that face! The broad brow was furrowed
with deep lines of mental distress. The boldly
chiselled nose was thinned, rather by muscular contraction
than by age. The model of the lip still presented
the curve of pride and habitual authority,
contrasting most painfully with the tremor of helpless
suspicion and childish anxiety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why will you not take me home?” he exclaimed
again—and his eye wandered restlessly from side to
side, peering through the door and windows of the
coach, as if in search of some object once familiar—with
an expression of hopeless distress that it was
difficult even to witness with fortitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To one familiar with large hospitals, the scene was
clearly intelligible. Insanity from disappointed hope
was mingled with the fatuity of premature old age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Propriety would have dictated my immediate
retreat, after the necessary care of the ladies in
alighting; but perceiving that the united persuasions
of mother and daughter were likely to fail in
inducing the grandfather to quit the coach without
too strongly inviting public attention towards a private
misfortune, I felt bound to inquire, “May I not
save you, madam! from some embarrassment by
begging you to enter the house? I will engage myself
to place your father under the protection of your
roof, in a very few minutes, and without annoyance.”
Nothing insures such instantaneous confidence
with the gentler sex as self-dependence in a
man, and grave, though courteous authority of manner.
The offer was accepted with a glance of mute
thankfulness, and handing the ladies to the door, I
returned to the carriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, my dear sir,” I said to the elderly gentleman,
“allow me the pleasure of assisting you to
alight! your horses are a little restive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir!” he replied; “you are in league with
them!—You lead me from place to place, and every
where you tell me I am at home!—Oh! I shall never
find it!—I wish to repose in my own house, and my
own garden!—<span class='it'>my mother’s house!</span>—and you bring
me here and tell me <span class='it'>this</span> is my house!—Do you think
I have grown so weak and imbecile as not to know
the chamber where I was born?—the garden where
I played when a child?—No!—I will not go in!—They
are kind to me here, but I am not at home!—Do,
take me home!—You seem to think that I cannot
tell the difference between this great palace,
with its rich carpets and its marble columns, and our
own little cottage, with its arbor of grape-vines and
wild-creepers, where my mother used to nurse me
to sleep in the old carved rocking-chair!—Oh! take
me home!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long habituated to the management of lunatics, I
had learned to guide the tangled reins of a disordered
mind, and found but little difficulty in persuading the
old man to rest awhile in the parlor on the plea of
examining whether his granddaughter, to whom he
was much attached, had not received some injury
by stumbling in her descent from the coach. Seating
him upon an ottoman, it was easy, by the same innocent
deception to withdraw to another apartment in
company with the ladies: and there, after tendering
any further services which their affliction might
render desirable, I heard, with deep attention, the
history of their woes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. A——, the old gentleman, was, as I had
inferred, the father of the elder and the grandsire
of the younger lady. At an early age he came into
hereditary possession of a handsome capital, and a
range of ample stores near the centre of the commercial
mart of ——.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His mother, who was esteemed rich in those early
times (soon after the revolutionary war) retained the
family homestead in addition to her dower; and, in
this venerable mansion, distant about a mile from
the borders of the <span class='it'>then</span> small, but flourishing city,
her son continued to reside; for he preferred the
society of his remaining parent, and the quietude of
rural life in the intervals of business, to the gayer
scenes and more luxurious habits of the town.
Thither, he soon conveyed a young and beautiful
wife; and there his happiest years were spent in
the midst of a family circle bound together by ties
of the warmest affection.—Even their dead were
gathered around them:—for the white monuments
of their departed friends peered over the stone wall
of the family grave-yard, from the grove of funereal
pines behind the garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this peaceful life of domestic enjoyment was
not destined to continue. Within a few years subsequent
to his marriage, there occurred one of those
sudden revolutions in trade which periodically
sweep, with the force of a deluge, over the commercial
interests of our country.—Mr. A⁠—— was
ruined!—He became dependent upon the resources
of his parent for the support of his wife; but pride
would not permit him to grant the urgent request of
his mother that he would share that support himself;
and he fled his native country for a time, to woo the
breeze of Fortune beneath other stars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After two long years of toil and danger among the
furs of the North-West, the hides of California, the
<span class='it'>biche-le-mer</span> and birds-nests of the Eastern Archipelagoes,
he arrived at the great entrepot of the Celestial
Empire with a cargo insuring him an ample competence,
just in time to receive intelligence of the
death of his wife, leaving to his charge an only child!
She had been the star of his destiny!—That star was
set, and darkness enshrouded his soul!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Recovering from this terrible shock, he shunned
the very idea of returning to the scene of his former
happiness. She for whom he had braved the deep!—had
toiled—had grappled with the sun of the tropics,—the
ice of the pole—had left him desolate!—the infant,
whom no parent welcomed to this world of trial,
was a stranger to him!—one whom he had never
beheld! and the only remaining link which bound
him to his country was his affection for an aged
mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But who is not aware that the noon of manhood—its
mid-day strife and bustle—are unfavorable to the
glow of filial affection? Maternal love,—the deepest—the
purest—the least selfish of human emotions!—knows
no ebb—no diminution on this side the grave!
Time, which may sap or shatter every other sympathy,
adds strength to this at every revolution of its
fatal glass!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not so the attachment of the offspring!—Like a
delicate flower which sheds its fragrance freely on
the morning or the evening air, but denies all sweetness
to the bold glance of noon, this feeling flourishes
only at the commencement and the close of our
career. When, at length, in the decline of our energies,
both mind and body verge once more towards
the feebleness of infancy, how painfully the affections
of earlier years flow back upon us!—Then
would we gladly repose our aching temples—aching
with the memory of many an unkind word or action—upon
the bosom from which we first drew sustenance!
and we yearn after a mother’s love with a
longing that will not be repressed!</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not surprising that Mr. A⁠——, thus suddenly
cut off by death from her whose welfare had been
the chief purpose of his life, should have buried his
gloom in the cares of business. Such is the usual
resource of those who bound their vision, as, alas!
too many are prone to do! within the narrow limits
of this sublunary theatre of action! For thirty years
he pursued the search of wealth beneath the burning
skies of India, with singleness of purpose and untiring
zeal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He remitted large sums, from time to time, for the
convenience of a mother to whom he was ever dutiful,
and a daughter that he had never seen; but his
letters were cold and formal. His child was married,—he
congratulated her. A grand-child was
born to him;—he sent her his blessing. His daughter
became a widow;—he condoled with her upon her
loss. But nothing could arouse him from his bootless
labor for superfluous gold!</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length, as age approached, he felt wearied with
his monotonous existence. With the decline of his
bodily powers came the desire for rest:—with the
weakening of his mental energies, the longing for
sympathy grew stronger and stronger. <span class='it'>He did not
wish to die alone!</span> Dreams of his juvenile days
came over him, and he sighed for the quietude of the
old family mansion, and the warm welcome of his
mother on his return from the cares of business.
When the sudden twilight of the tropics sunk
abruptly into night, he dreamed of the lingering glories
of an American evening. When he heard the cry of
the bramin kite, the harsh call of the adjutant crane,
and the chattering of a thousand obscene birds retiring
to their roosts, gorged with their horrible repast
on the corpses that pollute the Ganges, he longed for
the wild notes of the whip-poor-will, the rushing
sound of the night-hawk, and the melancholy hooting
of the owl, that render night musical in the
bright green woods of his native land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew that the growing city had swept far
beyond the retreat of his earlier days—that many
magnificent residences had risen over the site of his
boyish play-grounds, and that even the relics of his
dead had been removed from their original resting-place,
to make room for the house of the stranger.
He had permitted—<span class='it'>he had even advised these changes</span>,
but, he could not realize them! The old mansion
with its broad elms, the garden, and the pine-grove
with the monuments beneath its shade, were ever
present to his mind, and his letters were painfully
charged with allusions to scenes and persons whose
existence was blotted from the page of history.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With every year, these feelings became more and
more intense, until incipient childishness made its
appearance, and he became affected with a confirmed
nostalogia. At length he closed his concerns, remitted
the unappropriated balance of his earnings, and
launched himself once more upon the ocean, on his
homeward route.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he drew near his native shore, memory retraced
more and more vividly, the scenes of other days,
until his failing intellect began to confuse the present
with the past, and, at times, he dreamed of once
more welcoming the little circle of the loved and
cherished, in the same old wainscotted parlor,—around
the same wide, hospitable, antique fire-place,
where he slept with head reclined upon his mother’s
knee when the presence of company obtained him
the privilege of sitting up an hour beyond his usual
bed time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The vessel neared the port. The pilot, ever the
first to welcome the wanderer home, ascended the
deck and distributed the “papers” of the previous
day. With one of these, Mr. A⁠—— hastily retired
to the cabin. Not even the blue hills of his native
land, now full in sight, could wean him from the
fatal record. His eye glanced rapidly over the
leading article, but the struggle of contending candidates
had no charm for him. He furtively regarded
the items of foreign news;—was shocked at the long
record of crimes and casualties made piquant and
racy with details and comments which the purer
manners of his early years would not have tolerated;
and, for the first time in his life, he turned from the
<span class='it'>price current</span> in disgust, but why did he start, turn
pale, and tremble when his eye rested upon the
ominous black lines that cross the final column of
the second page? The identical paper is still preserved,
and I extract the notice!—Read!</p>

<hr class='tbk118'/>

<p class='pindent'>Died, suddenly, of apoplexy, on the 29th inst., in
the 96th year of her age, Mrs. C⁠—— A⁠——, the
venerable relict of the late Hon. W⁠—— A⁠——, and
mother of Mr. H⁠—— A⁠——, the distinguished American
merchant at ——.</p>

<hr class='tbk119'/>

<p class='pindent'>The cup was full! There breathed not in the land
of his birth one kindred being to unite him with the
past!—His daughter!—she was a stranger! How
should he recognise her in the stranger crowd!—The
mind, already weakened, was crushed!—The
cracked vase was shivered!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moment the anchor dropped, he leaped into a
boat, and hurried on shore. Calling the nearest
coach he ordered it in haste and sternly, “To ——’s
lane, half a mile from the turnpike gate of the ——
road!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The astonished driver stared as he replied,
“There’s no such lane now, sir! I heard of it
when I was a boy, but it’s all built up long ago, and
I never knew even where it was!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then drive me to my mother’s,” cried Mr.
A⁠——, in a voice almost of fury; and holding forth
the paper, which had never left his hand, he pointed
to the notice. An old man, standing by, struck by
the haggard and maniacal look, perused the article
and simply said, “Drive to the marble building, No.
20 —— Place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The grieving survivers of the family of Mrs.
A⁠—— were sitting silently in the darkened parlor,
on the morning after the funeral, when a loud appeal
at the bell startled the whole household—so ill did it
accord with the silence of grief brooding over all
who had lived under the mild influence of the departed!
A female attendant hurried to the door, and
was instantly thrust to the wall by one who rushed
furiously past her, crying aloud and wildly, “Where
is my wife!—my mother!” Mr. A⁠—— actually
sprang into the presence of the ladies; for he was
endowed for the moment with unnatural strength by
the intensity of feeling. The figure of the elder lady,
as she started to her feet in terror on the sudden intrusion,
appeared to awaken some long dormant recollection,
for he checked, on the instant, his precipitate
advance, regarded her intently for a moment,
and approaching gently, but before her alarm permitted
her to move, he laid his hands upon her
shoulders, and read her features with a steady and
protracted gaze that seemed to search her very
soul! “No! no!” he cried, “You are not my
Jane!” and fainted at her feet.</p>

<hr class='tbk120'/>

<p class='pindent'>In the cemetery of ——, where the eye stretches
wide and far over beautiful wooded slopes and a
broad expanse of water—rock, ravine, spire, hamlet,
and the distant city—where all is peace, and the
weary soul is tempted to covet the repose of those
who wait beneath,—now rest the remains of Mr. A⁠——.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“After life’s fitful fever, he sleeps well!”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Standing beside his grave, as the moon-beams
flickered on the marble, contending with the shadows
of o’erhanging leaves that rustled in the night-breeze,
I thought how rapidly every haunt of my
own bright, holiday youth was yielding to the inroads
of another populous capital. The pond on which we
used to ply the armed heel when winter ruled the
year, has disappeared.—Its site is occupied with
civic palaces. The shady glen where the winged
hours of starry summer nights flew all unheeded by
in converse with the loved who are no more, lies
bare and sered beneath the August sun!—The very
stream that wound so gracefully among the trees is
dry!—The dews of heaven that fed its crystal
sources fall now in vain upon a mountain mass of
marble—column,—plynth and dome—rising in mockery
of <span class='it'>posthumous benevolence</span>,—a long enduring
witness of perverted trust! Where are the few and
fondly cherished who shared the converse of those
happy hours?—One lies deep in the coral groves of
the Hesperides!—One fell a victim to a philanthropic
spirit when the plague of Indoostan ravaged the
vallies of the West!—Another!—Strangers tread
lightly round his narrow house in the gardens of
Père-la-Chaise!—The last—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Peace to thy broken heart and early grave!”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>But why repeat these woes that are the lot of
all?—Who is there that has learned the value of the
baubles that entice us <span class='it'>here</span>—Wealth! Fame! Power!
or sublunary Love!—but will join in the secret aspiration
with which I left the silent resting-place of
a perturbed spirit—“Take! oh! Take me home!”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>A STORY OF MOORISH SPAIN.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY MARY S. PEASE.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Many</span> years ago there dwelt, not far from Seville,
in a castle so old it was a wonder what kept it from
tumbling down, a Spanish hidalgo, remarkable for
but two things—a very beautiful daughter, and the
very strict manner in which he secluded her from
the world. In every other respect this hidalgo was
like other hidalgos, full of pride, sporting a pair of
Spanish mustachios, and wearing a stiletto by his
side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wonderful beauty of his daughter, the Doña
Ysabel, had somehow—in spite of the seclusion in
which she was kept—become proverbial, and the
fame thereof had spread from Gibraltar to the
Pyrenees. Not a caballero of that chivalric country
but would have given his best steed for one glance
from the eyes of the hidalgo’s daughter—eyes which
shrouded under their long lashes, were like diamonds
winning across the midnight. Her hair was
silky and soft, darker and more glossy than the
raven’s wing—and in such luxuriance did it grow
that she might almost have hid herself in it, as did
“the lady of the golden locks” in the fairy tale.
Her face was fitful as an April day. It was the clear
and faithful mirror to the warmest, purest heart in
all Spain. And never did a young heart beat within
a lighter and more graceful form than that of the
Doña Ysabel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The castle where the hidalgo resided with his
daughter was built on a rocky eminence, in one of
the wildest parts of the country. Tradition said it
had been erected by a powerful and wealthy Moor,
from whom it had been conquered by the strong arm
of one of the present occupant’s ancestors. The
father of Ysabel had resided there but rarely until
the death of his wife; but, after that event, he had
retired almost broken-hearted to this wild retreat.
Here, from early childhood, the Lady Ysabel had
been brought up. Wanting the care of a mother,
she had always been left to have her own way, and
a more self-willed, impetuous sylph never dashed
the dew from the wild flowers that grew so luxuriantly
around the Moorish castle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day, when the Doña Ysabel had nearly
attained her sevententh year, the Count de Llenaro,
her father, stood within the deep embrasure of the
richly carved corridor, absorbed in thought. His
eyes were fixed on the shadows that played so fancifully
on the rocks below. A light step was heard
and a fairy form entered the apartment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Bella mi cara nina</span>, I was thinking of thee, I
would speak with thee.” And the gentle girl stood
beside the proud lord. “What wouldst thou my
father?” The maiden’s voice was low and silvery
soft. Her dark eye looked up into her father’s with
an expression soft and confiding as childhood. One
little snow-white hand rested upon his shoulder,
while the other nestled within his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How old are you, Ysy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall be seventeen come next Michaelmas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis even as I thought. Thou art getting to be a
great girl, Belle,—I have something to say to thee;
wilt thou listen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear papa, thy word is my law.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it so?” and the father fixed his eyes upon the
girl with a look so penetrating that her own eye fell,
and the rich warm blood rushed from her young
heart and burnt upon her brow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Llenaro seated himself upon a low <span class='it'>turco</span>, and drawing
his child towards him, he fondly kissed her glowing
cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fear, Belle,” said he, putting back the world of
curls that had fallen over her brow, “thy will hath
never yet been broken. Thou art but a wild one.”
Count Alcaros fell into a long fit of musing. The
silver breathing tones of the Doña’s soft voice broke
the stillness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What wouldst thou with thy child, papa? my birds,
and young flowers, even now mourn my absence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And canst thou not give one hour unto thy father,
Ysy? What will thy birds and flowers do when I
bring thee a right noble bird, an eagle among birds,
for thine own? Wilt thou then give up all others
and love but only that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does my papa mean?” tremblingly replied
the maiden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean that thou art to be a child no longer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, papa, all my pretty birds and⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thou shalt have a bird worth the whole, a right
proud gallant bird. Ysy, dost thou remember the
Marquis of Talavera?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What of him, dearest papa?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dost thou remember him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, papa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This Marquis hath sought thee, Belle, in marriage,
and I have said thou shalt be his bride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl started to the ground in unfeigned surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, papa! he is old enough to be my grandfather,
and besides, he is ugly enough to⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is just the age of thy father, Ysabel. His years
will serve to guide thy wayward ones. He is all
that is brave and noble, besides being one of the richest,
and most powerful lords in Spain. You may
know, Belle, how well I think of him—he is almost
the only one of my many <span class='it'>friends</span>, that I admit into
this our wild retreat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, papa—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, Belle, I will have no buts. It must be as I
say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, papa.” The Count’s brow darkened. “But,
papa, I do not love him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love—pah!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Papa, I <span class='it'>cannot</span> love him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pah!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Papa, I <span class='it'>will not</span> love him!” and the Doña’s eyes
grew bright and large.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ysabel!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear papa,—I mean I cannot—” and the little
lady burst into tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ysabel,—hear me—I have said thou shalt become
the bride of the Marquis of Talavera. What I say I
never unsay—that thou knowest. Two weeks from
this. The day thou art seventeen—is the day decided
upon. It <span class='it'>must, it shall be so</span>! Wilt thou do thy
father’s bidding, Belle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl answered not a word but her eye lit up
and her little mouth was tightly compressed. Every
line of her statue-like form expressed firmness and
resolution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wilt thou do thy father’s bidding, Ysabel?”
again demanded the Count.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thou hast ever been an indulgent father to me,
never hast thou crossed my slightest wish, and now,
father, I must say firmly <span class='it'>no</span>! I never can become
the bride of him thou namest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Girl! thou shalt not even be consulted. Thou
hast had thine own way seventeen years, <span class='it'>now</span> I will
have mine. Thou shalt wed the Talavera if I have
to drag thee to the altar. Nay, no fawning.” The
girl had twined her soft round arms about her father’s
neck—her eyes looked beseechingly into his. But
he pushed her from him, saying—“Go to thy room,
Ysabel, and there remain until thy reason comes to
thee. Dost thou hear me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Spaniard strode from the room, and the weeping
lady sought, with a heavy heart, her own turret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the first time her father had been unkind to
her, and she threw herself down, on a low couch, in
all that utter hopelessness of grief youth alone can
feel. It was her first sorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There came a soft rap at the door,—but she heeded
it not;—and not until a hand, soft as woman’s, held
her own,—and a voice, whose deep, low tones were
breathing music, whispered in her ear, did she know
her father’s handsome page was kneeling by her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Weep not, mi cara Ysabel,” soothingly said he,
“or rather let me share thy grief. I know it all—thy
father hath told me, and sent me here to bring thee
to reason, as he said. Can I do it sweet lady?”
and the handsome page smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was wicked in him to smile when her heart was
so full of grief—and so the lady thought. But she
had learned to love, and when love is warm and new,
all the loved one says or does is more than right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Doña Ysabel loved her father’s page,—loved
him as an ardent-souled daughter of sunny Spain
knows how to love. The father!——he did not
even dream of such wickedness. (If he had he could
not have slept for at least six months)—the unpardonable
wickedness of a daughter of his—his bright,
beautiful Ysabel—the high born lady of Llenaro,—loving
her father’s page!—a nameless page!—and
so he slept secure. The thought was too preposterous.
And the Doña Ysabel loved. Love is all trustfulness,
all watchfulness, all hopefulness. The page
was handsome; the page was graceful, witty, accomplished.
He was indeed an uncommon page;—and
so thought the Doña’s father,—and <span class='it'>so</span> thought her
father’s daughter. He could sing to the music of
Ysabel’s guitar, most divinely; he could dance, fence,
was perfectly skilled in all horsemanship, moreover
he was acquainted with all the then lore of bright
Spain. He wrote poetry too; and sang the words of
his own composing. In sooth he was a most marvellous
page—a perfect paragon of a page; and
then his eye—why it was wilder than lightning shot
from a midnight sky. The servants all feared and
hated him. To Ysabel alone was he all that was
gentle,—and to her father, for her sake. He was her
teacher; her patient, faithful, untiring teacher. They
drank together at the pure well of learning—a well
too often untasted in those days of fair Spain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Weep not, sweetest; thy noble father would see
thee wed with the Marquis of Talavera, and thou
canst not love him. And it is for that thou weepest.
Is it not so sweet lady?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was happy,” replied the sorrowing girl. “I
did not dream of love, or that I had a heart. I only
felt that I was happy. And now⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now, my gentle Ysabel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now,” said the Señorita, deeply blushing,
“now I feel I have no heart to give.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless thee, dearest, for those words. Ysabel
hear me for I must speak. I love thee Ysabel—I am
other than I seem. I am no hireling—I am the heir
to a noble house. One year ago, having heard so
much of thy wondrous beauty, and full of curiosity
and daring, I contrived to get admitted into the
castle as thy father’s page. To see, is to love thee—but
to be near thee day after day—to read thy
gentle thoughts—to gaze in thy liquid, truthful, soul-beaming
eyes—to feel thy soft hand within my own.
Ysabel, a being cut from granite to see thee thus
could not help loving thee. I love <span class='it'>a soul</span>—a soul
thou hast sweet Ysabel—a reflecting, gentle, trustful,
ardent, heart-ful soul. Ysabel I love thee, wilt thou
love me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jose, I will, I do love thee”—and the girl’s
eyes were soft as she rested them in his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took her hand—her little, warm, white hand,
and covered it with kisses. Then drawing her
gently towards him, he clasped her silently to his
heart. She nestled like a bird in his bosom—and
rested her head there. At intervals a low sob
swelled her little heart, like that of a wearied infant,
worn out with much crying. At length her sighs
came less and less frequent; and when the page
bent over to gaze upon her face, she had sunk into a
calm, gentle sleep. A bright tear still glistened on
her silky lash—that long black fringe that reposed so
quietly on her pale, fair cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is something inexpressibly touching in the
quiet and calm repose of a beautiful girl. And
when we feel that that youth and beauty is all we
love on earth—that it is near us—nestling in sweet
trust within our arms—our all—our own—life of our
life—heart of our heart—soul of our soul—what
other happiness can earth give more pure, more holy,
more unalloyed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The page Jose almost wished the Doña might
never awake—but she did awake. And when she
did, she looked up in his eyes and smiled. There
was everything in that smile, love, hope, faith, gentleness,
truth, trust, joy. It was a droll smile too;
there was archness in it—Jose never forgot that
smile!—Strange, that an outward symbol of the inner
world can express so much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The page attempted to kiss the bright smile into
his own heart—but the lady’s mood had changed.
Half ashamed, half in sport, she broke from him
with a laugh—her own peculiar laugh—bird-like in
its silvery clearness; and like a bird, as wild, and
sweet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down, dear Ysabel—I would talk with thee
calmly—wilt thou be mine? Ysabel, I love thee.
Oh! how I love thee. Naught on earth is half so
dear as thou—life—ten thousand lives, were they
mine, would I give for thy love. Wilt thou be mine?
my own?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl put both her little hands in his—that was
her only answer. And then the page drew her again
to his heart and kissed her brow and lips. And then—and
then—and then—why then, and there, right up
before them—with curled lip and cloudy brow—stood
the castle’s lord!—the proud hidalgo!—the
Count Alcaros de Llenaro!—the Doña Ysabel’s
father!—the handsome page’s master!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha!” exclaimed he, “is this the way ye obey
my commands? Ah, I see! Thou’rt doing my bidding,
sir page. Hast thou won the self-willed lady
to think as I do? Away, girl!—Back, I say! Away
with thee, page!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pale, drooping, quailing beneath her father’s angry
glance, the gentle girl silently twined her arms
around his frame, and strove to kiss away the angry
spot upon his brow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Back! Judas!” exclaimed he, pushing her
rudely from him. “When thou hast learned to do
thy father’s wishes, <span class='it'>then</span> will he accept thy caresses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frightened—crushed—she shrunk within herself,
like the sensitive plant at some rude touch, nor
dared to raise her gentle eye to the fire-darting ones
of her angry sire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the page?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The father glanced from the drooping form of his
daughter to the unbending one of the presumptuous
lover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so, sir menial, thou art aspiring—we like
ambition. Thou thinkest to love my daughter—the
daughter of the noble house of Llenaro—good!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Count of Llenaro—hear me. I ask of thee thy
daughter. My house, proud lord, is full as noble as
thine own—perhaps more ancient. I am no page—I
am the only son of⁠——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will not even hear who thou art—wert thou
the monarch of the universe, thou shouldst not wed
my daughter. I have sworn she shall become the
bride of the Talavera—I never recall an oath.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The group as they stood there would have made a
picture for the pencil of a Salvator. The proud, determined
figure of Llenaro, standing with his arms
folded, looking lightning on the no less proud form of
the handsome page, as he stood in the glow of his
young manhood’s strength and beauty. Then the
shrinking form of the Doña Ysabel—slightly leaning
forward, with clasped hands—her head partly raised—the
speechless, imploring agony of her lovely face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room contributed not a little to the scene—all
around was purely, beautifully feminine. The low
damask ottomans—the bright-eyed birds in their
glittering gold cages—the rich, mellow paintings
hanging around the room. Among them was her
own soft eyed mother. The sweet, dreamy eyes of
the Italian seemed to look down on the father of her
daughter reproachfully for his harshness to that
daughter. The parting beams of the sun, as he bade
adieu to his love the fair earth, streamed in the
room, gilding with their warm glow the expressive
faces of the three. A ray more softened fell on the
calm, angel face of the wife,—the mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alcaros de Llenaro, I entreat thee to listen to
me. On my knees I supplicate thee to give me thy
daughter. Doom her not to misery. She loves me.
Think upon thy child’s mother—on the love vows
given and taken before thy child was born. When
she—the mother, the wife, was all in all to thee.
Thou <span class='it'>didst</span> love once, and she thou didst love, was
the mother of the child thou’rt dooming to wretchedness—and
now that mother looks down upon thee,
imploring happiness on her child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alcaros glanced at the image of his wife. He
fancied, as the warm, red sunlight fell upon it, the
gentle eyes looked a reproachful gaze on him. He
was not a hard-hearted man. Pride was his ruling
passion. False pride it might have been; whether
false or true, it fastened on him then, driving back
the kindlier feelings the memory of his wife had
roused within him. He checked the tear before
it came to his eyes, and putting on a heavy frown—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rise, sir minion,” said he, “I have told thee
my daughter shall wed the Talavera—<span class='it'>and she
shall!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Never!</span> as I live, never!” said the girl. “Never
shall a Llenaro become the bride of the man she
cannot love!—never!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lady looked her father’s child—as though she
had been born to be obeyed. The softness of the
mother had gone. Her slight, round figure, straight
as a young Indian’s, had risen to its full height. Her
eyes dilated—those eyes, where shone her soul—those
warm, black eyes, whose every glance kept
time to the throbbings of her impulsive heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ysabel,” said Llenaro, sadly, after a pause, “thou
forgetest I am thy father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father! dearest papa!—my own father, forgive
me. Thou <span class='it'>art</span> my father! but do not,” her
tones were low and earnest, “oh! do not force this
hated match on thy child. She will do anything—<span class='it'>all</span>
thou wishest—but oh! do not seal her misery
forever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The count permitted the ardent caresses of the
maiden, then putting her gently from him, he told
her to remain in her turret. He had much to say to
her. He would seek her when he was ready to
tell her what he had to say. Then turning to Jose,
he added, “Follow me, sir page, I have somewhat
to say to thee also.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The maiden watched the receding forms of the
two until they had disappeared, and then she murmured,
“He spoke kindly to me,” and <span class='it'>Hope</span> warmed
her heart. A bright Hope! Hope the deceiver!
What would the world be without thee, fairy Hope?
Thou comest like a dream, whispering in our soul’s
ear thy witching fancies, until they seem realities—and
the <span class='it'>is to be</span>, stands before us a living <span class='it'>now</span>!
Great is thy power, fair Hope—and thou knowest it,—and
so thou goest on deluding mortals,—making
the dim shadowy perspective a glorious foreground.
So, when our hearts feel sad and weary, and long
to burst the chain that binds them to this dark earth,
thou comest with the dews of heaven fresh glistening
on thy lips—and tellest us fairy tales, and
singest us fairy songs—and kissest our hearts with
thy cool, dewy lips. And we believe thee, syren,
and let thee deceive us again and again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lady Ysabel rested her wild, black eyes—beaming
with a thousand thoughts—upon her mother’s
picture, and kneeling before it, she clasped
her little hands and implored her gentle mother to
look down kindly on her daughter. “And, mother,”
continued she—her lute-like voice scarce audible—“ask
<span class='it'>Him</span>, the mighty one—whose throne is in high
heaven—to forgive thy erring child, if she forgets,
in her love for the creature, the Creator. God forgive
me if I love <span class='it'>him</span> more than I ought, for I cannot
love him less.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lady Ysabel watched all that evening for her
father, and the next day—and the next—and the
next—and then her cheek began to pale, and her
eye grew dim with weeping. For Hope had grown
weary and fled. She could not dream either why
the page came not—a little indignation mingled with
her sorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The duenna did all she could to restore her young
lady to her right mind, as she said. At length she
brought her a letter—saying⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take it, <span class='it'>mi</span> señorita, a holy friar gave it me for
thee. Learn from it, Señorita Ysabel, to control thy
too great grief. It is sinful and wrong to indulge in
sorrow as thou dost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lady Ysabel knew the writing—tremblingly
she broke the seal, and read,</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>My gentle Ysabel</span>—Thy father hath forbidden
me the castle, or ever to see thee again—but fear
not, dearest, thy father cannot withstand thy gentleness—thy
goodness. Thou wert not made to be unhappy—thou
art too good—too kind—too true. God
will not see thee made wretched. He watches over
thee. He will not desert thee—and, dearest, remember
there is one heart that beats for thee—and
thee alone—whose every pulse is thine. Sunshine
is midnight without the light of thine eyes to tell
where shineth the sun, and when, gentlest, I would
see thee, I would press thy hands upon my heart—that
its wild throbbings might be stilled. I would
look into the clear depths of thy truthful eyes, and
learn there a lesson of calmness—of faith to bear,
and hope to look beyond. Thy duenna, sweetest,
more than mistrusts my disguise—but a golden bait
has lured stronger minds than hers from the clear
waters of truth. I cannot quit the castle grounds,
for in it is all that is dear to me on earth. Write,
dearest, if thou canst, to thine own</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;margin-top:0.5em;'><span class='sc'>Jose</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The lady sat before her scrutoire to write to him
she loved, when she heard her father’s step. She
had only time to crumple his letter in her bosom as
the father entered. Ever obedient to her heart’s
impulse, she sprang towards him, and throwing her
white arms about his neck, she called him her dear,
<span class='it'>dear</span> papa, and burst into tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Calm thyself, my Ysabel. I would tell thee
frankly why I ask thee to sacrifice thyself—to seal
thy misery, as thou sayest.” He led her gently to
an ottoman, and seated himself beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ysabel, wouldst thou see thy father penniless,
homeless, a beggar?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Papa!” looked the wondering eyes of Ysabel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I repeat it, Ysy, wouldst thou see thy father
resign all these fair acres, and starve a houseless
beggar? Wouldst thou, Ysy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What meanest thou, papa? in mercy tell me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If by one act of thine, it were in thy power to
make thy father’s happiness, wouldst thou not do
that act?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear papa, thou knowest I would—but oh! tell
me all. What am I to do? And yet I know—but
<span class='it'>why</span>? tell me why”⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ysabel, by becoming his bride, thou canst save
thy father from becoming a beggar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl shuddered but said in a low calm voice,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father, tell me why—tell me <span class='it'>all</span>. Make a confidant
of thy child. I can bear anything. See! I am
calm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ysabel, I will! in as few words as possible. A
year ago, you may remember, Talavera was here.
He has not been here since. A short time after that,
his last visit, the page came—though it is not of him
I would speak. We played—Talavera and I. At
first I won—in the success of the moment I staked
high—and lost. I still played on—every throw
swept off acre after acre of the lands my fathers
owned. Midnight saw me without a farthing—and
without a foot of earth to call my own. Then came
a bond. I signed it. It gave me back my broad
lands—my wealth—but it deprived me of the only
thing I had on earth to love—of you, my Ysabel!
See! here is the bond.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lady’s heart was still—very still—so still it
almost frightened her. Her cheek, lips, hands,
were cold and bloodless. It seemed as though her
blood had all gone to her heart—and frozen there!
Her eye was passionless, it was so calm. She held
the open paper before her, and without reading or
seeing, she read and saw enough to know that the
fair grounds and castle of Ysolo-Rosse—where she
had lived from her infancy—where her father had
loved her mother—were to go into the hands of the
Talavera, unless she became his bride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ysabel, I have sworn thou shalt be his bride,
but I will recall my oath if thou sayest so. What is
thy decision?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will wed him,” replied the girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Llenaro clasped her to his heart, and kissing her
cold brow, he added,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The day thou art seventeen was the day decided
upon—it will be here in a week. But if ’twill be
too soon, no doubt the Marquis will”⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Twill not be too soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ysabel, thou frightenest me, thou art so pale—I
will not force thee into what would be thy unhappiness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, papa, I had much rather be unhappy myself
than to see thee so. But I will not be. To-morrow
thou shalt see me more cheerful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wily lord had learned the way to make his
daughter’s will his own. He loved that daughter,
and felt a father’s pity for her. But he thought
although she suffered then—and it pained him to the
soul to see it—she would soon forget her youthful
passion, and, as the wife of the Talavera, she would
gradually learn to be happy. Her future husband
was all that was noble and good—all this thought
the father—and then he thought “the Castle of Ysolo-Rosse
will still be mine.” The father’s conscience
was <span class='it'>almost</span> quieted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have foresworn playing, Belle,” said he, sadly,
“never, should I live forever, will another card pass
through my hands. Ysabel, my darling child! do
not look so sad,—seek the cool air, it will revive thee.
Go and gather thy favorite wild flowers: they will
divert thy mind from its sorrow. My noble, generous
girl.” He fondly kissed his child and then withdrew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ysabel left to herself mechanically sought the
garden. She wandered over her favorite haunts,
scarce knowing what she did. Her heart, her
thoughts were still as the grave. She reached her
bower—the little vine-clad bower, where the page
and she had so often sat listening to the music of
each other’s voices. And there, on the very seat
where they were wont to sit—was Jose! the page!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ysabel! beloved!” exclaimed he in unfeigned
delight—and the girl was in his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dearest, best, my gentle Ysabel! am I once more
permitted to see thee?—to clasp thee to my heart?
But, sweetest, how thou hast changed. How pale
thou art. Go with me dearest, I will be thy father,
brother, husband, friend. Leave this hated castle—now—speak,
dear one, wilt thou go with me? Dear,
<span class='it'>dear</span> Ysabel, tell me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jose, I cannot—I have promised to become his
bride!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, dearest, they shall not force thee to do what
thou dost not wish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jose, I had my own free choice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And thou didst choose—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To become his bride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will nothing induce thee to alter thy determination?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Nothing!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good bye, Ysabel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jose! Dear Jose—” but the page was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning found the lady Ysabel in the
spot where the page had left her. Then followed
many days of sickness. Her life was despaired of.
Day after day she lay, pale, cold, insensible. Reason
had forsaken her throne. Her sweet smiles were
gone; and the speaking glances of her dewy eyes
had fled. Her voice too—for she had not spoken
since that night. Even the pulsations of her heart
were silent. Life alone remained—life without its
light. And how her father watched over her—and
how bitterly he lamented, and cursed himself for
having brought her thus. At length light shone in
her eyes—the light of life. Morning dawned in upon
the darkness of her soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Good bye, Ysabel</span>,” said she.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My own child, what dost thou say?” asked the
father, bending anxiously over her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good bye, Ysabel—” and she looked up in her
father’s face and smiled.—<span class='it'>That smile!</span> it haunted
him to his grave!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you better, my own Ysabel? my dearest
child?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes papa,—I am well. What a strange dream I
have had. Ah! now I recollect—” and she sunk
into a gentle sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Day by day she gained health and strength. The
father never left her side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Papa,” said she one day, “will you let me see that
paper again? you know the one I mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, my child, you never need see or think of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do let me take it, papa—you do not know how
well and strong I am—do, dearest papa?” And the
father was prevailed upon. She saw she could save
her father from ruin, and her mind was made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How old am I, papa?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three weeks ago saw you seventeen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does the—does my future husband know of my
illness?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has sent repeatedly to inquire after your
health. His courier was here this morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you send him word I am well—and am
ready in two weeks from now to become his wife?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you in earnest, Ysabel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perfectly so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it of your own free will you speak?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is, papa.” And the father was deceived—perhaps
too willingly so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lady Ysabel was able now to revisit her
favorite haunts. Every thing she saw brought the
page vividly before her eyes. Sometimes an inscription
on a tree—the walks, the flowers, the bower
where last they met—all, all brought with them the
memory of <span class='it'>him</span>. She strove to banish, as high treason
to her happiness, all thoughts of him—and the
firmness of her nature conquered. She familiarised
herself to all the old spots where she had loved to be
with him—and she thought she was happy—almost—happy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day at length came—clear—cloudless—sun-bright.
And then the lady’s heart misgave her—she
said not a word, however, but let them deck her in
her bridal gear, scarce knowing or caring what they
did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evening came. The chapel was brilliantly lighted.
The bright red wine flowed freely—and joy danced
in all hearts, save one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ysabel was pale, very, very pale when she entered
the chapel. The orange buds that wreathed her hair
were not more pale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Talavera had not yet come. All was ready.
The priest in his long flowing robes—the father—the
bridesmaid—the guests; for the father had
invited many a noble house to witness his daughter’s
nuptials. All were ready, and still the bridegroom
came not. At length was heard a confused movement,
and, in the midst of that joyous mass of life,
the Marquis of Talavera had been thrown from his
carriage, and the servants, in their fright and dismay,
scarce knowing what they did, had borne him in his
litter to the chapel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lady Ysabel grew even more pale, as she
looked upon the bier. There lay the lord who was
to have been her husband! She gazed on him in a
sort of nightmare fascination—a weight seemed
taken from her heart—a feeling of relief mingled
with the horror of the hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Doña Ysabel enjoyed one short month of tranquillity—and
then came news from the castle of Talavera.
The will of the marquis had been read. He
had bequeathed to his son and heir all his vast estates
together with the Lady Ysabel, should he himself die
before the marriage took place. The <span class='it'>bond</span> still held
good!</p>

<p class='pindent'>A letter came from the young marquis to the count,
demanding his daughter’s hand in marriage. The
letter was gracefully written, and told how he had
long heard of the wondrous beauty of the Doña Ysabel,
and how ardently he desired to become the possessor
of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the lady yielded to her father’s persuasion.
The present marquis was young and handsome—so
the objection of age was removed. All Spain knew
he was noble, and brave—and all the bright-eyed
daughters of Spain might well look envy on the
favored Ysabel, that the young Talavera had chosen
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was then travelling in the interior of Europe.
His letter was dated, Vienna. One year from the
day of the elder Talavera’s death was the day fixed
upon to celebrate the bridals of the bravest cavalier
and loveliest flower in all Spain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ysabel yielded, and tried to seem cheerful, but her
step grew slower and slower, and her fair face paler
and more pale. As her days went on did she each
day lose some part of this earth, earthy. So very
gradual was the change that neither her father nor
those around her seemed to observe it. So passed
seven months. Four months more were to find her a
new home in the heart of the Talavera.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She daily visited the spot where she had last seen
<span class='it'>him</span>, in the hope of——she knew not what.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Doña Ysabel was in her bower—neither reading,
nor sewing, nor watching her flowers—but in a
state of listlessness, half reclining on the cushioned
seat, when suddenly her name was spoken! It
was not her father’s voice. The next instant saw
the Doña close to the heart of the page, Jose!
Neither spoke—the heart of each was too full for
words—dull words cannot express our strongest emotions,
when the heart is too big for utterance, speech
is but a mockery. Words came at length, and the
page told her how much anguish he had suffered,
and how he could no longer stay away from her he
loved. That he came, hardly expecting to see her,
and if he did see her, he feared he should find her
changed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, dearest Ysabel, thou art changed—not in
thy love—but thou art but the shadow of the Ysabel
that in days syne, bounded so joyfully over these
hills.” He held up her hand⁠—</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Lady Ysabel told the page <span class='it'>all</span>. How that she
had consented to become the bride of the young Talavera.
The page learned the reason from her too,
why she had consented to become the wife of one
she could not love. He smiled when he heard that
the Talavera must become master, either of the
castle and property of Ysolo-Rosse, or of the lovely
Lady Ysabel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Ysabel retired to rest that night, it was with
a light heart. Day after day witnessed the meetings
of the lady and the page—and day after day witnessed
her returning bloom of face and buoyancy of
heart. She was once more that glad, bright Ysabel
as when the page first came to her father’s castle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The father, without inquiring the cause, saw his
child happy and smiling, and he was satisfied. And
she <span class='it'>was</span> happy and smiling—the smiles never left
her little dimpled mouth—soon as one went another
came. Even in her sleep, her joyous heart beamed
from her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morning came bright and sunshiny as it had
done just one year before. The chapel was again
illuminated—again were the guests assembled—and
again, surrounded by her bridesmaids, came the Lady
Ysabel into the chapel. But oh! what a different
Lady Ysabel from the one of the year ago. The
bridal wreath encircled her brow—and below that
fair brow beamed out the <span class='it'>happiest</span> pair of eyes imaginable!
What could it mean?</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was heard among the guests a universal murmur
of admiration as she made her appearance. So
beautiful, so bright, so radiant a being they had never
seen. Her face appeared actually to <span class='it'>emit light</span>—so
truly did the bright sunshine of her glad young heart
shine through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A slight movement at the great double door of the
chapel—and the bridegroom, the Marquis of Talavera
was announced!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quite as great a sensation did the noble, manly
figure of the young marquis create, as had the softer
and more gentle one of the Lady Ysabel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The father seemed struck dumb in sudden surprise!—at
length, burst from his lips—“The page!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Any of the old gossips of Spain will tell you the
rest of the story—and what a joyous wedding
there was—and how every one said there never was
so well matched—so noble a pair, as Don Jose,
Marquis of Talavera, and his gentle bride, Ysabel!
They will tell you, too, that the honey-moon, instead
of lasting but thirty-one days, did outlast thirty-one
years!—and the love that was true to the sire could
not but bless the son.</p>

<hr class='tbk123'/>

<p class='pindent'>So endeth the story of “<span class='sc'>The Lady and the
Page</span>.”</p>

<div><h1><a id='imag'></a>IMAGINATION.<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> is so long a time since a poem of any serious
pretensions has made its appearance before the British
or American public, that we have almost ceased
to look for new metrical productions, divided into
books or cantos. We have been contented with the
light, fugitive strains of the periodicals, and have not
asked for grand overtures—such as used to absorb
the whole interest of the reading public, twenty,
thirty, fifty and more years ago. In the middle of the
last century, a man, to be recognised as a poet, was
required to issue some single work of a thousand
lines. Quantity was more considered than quality;
intellectual labor was judged of rather by the amount
of its achievements than by their kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poetry has at times been criticised by a different
rule than Painting. That age never was, when an
artist acquired a reputation in consequence of the
number of his pictures: one gem of art has always
been more highly esteemed than a million crystals.
In all days past, as in the day present, it might be
said of a single head by a master, small, faded, stained,
yet beautiful through the rust of age,—“that
little bit of canvass is worth more than a whole gallery
of fresh portraits, though after living models, as
beautiful as Aspasia, or as stately as Alcibiades.”
But a solitary brief poem was never so valued in
comparison with a voluminous production. Even
now, formed and polished as the public taste pretends
itself to be, there lurks with us that prejudice which
more highly ranks the author of a book of verses
than the author of a sonnet. Though the book may
be as negative in merit as the correct hand of gentle
dullness could make it, and the sonnet as perfect as
the best that Petrarch wrote, in the intensest glow
of his love and his genius—except by the few, the
former would be regarded as the more arduous, the
more commendable performance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The philosophy of this prejudice, is a sort of respect
mankind entertains for a constant fulfilment of
the original curse. We love to see hard work done
or indicated. We look at a mass of printed leaves
and exclaim, “Goodness! what an industrious individual
the writer must have been! How much he
has accomplished!” It may be that, upon examination,
his work may have added nothing to the available
stock of literature; it may be that it will prove
useless lumber, destined to dust and obscurity in
men’s garrets, and not worth the corners it will encumber.
“What of that? the author had to work
hard to do it—didn’t he?” Yes! such is the question
put by people who seem to love labor for its own
sake. They look upon men of talent very much in
the same light that old Girard of Philadelphia considered
poor people who existed by the employment
of their arms and legs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a season of distress, some day-laborers applied
to Girard for assistance. There was a huge pile of
bricks lying in the vicinity of the house of Dives.
“Take up those bricks,” said he, “and place them
yonder, and then I will pay you for the task.” The
men obeyed; the bricks—to use a verb for which we
are indebted to Dr. Noah Webster and the Georgia
negroes—were <span class='it'>toted</span> from one position to another,
and the stipulated price demanded. Girard paid it
cheerfully. “But,” said the laborers, “what are we
to do now? Must we be idle while we spend this
money, and starve by and by? We shall come to
you again in a week. Keep us employed—bid us
perform another task.” “Yes,” said Girard. “Take
up those bricks from the place where you have put
them, and carry them back to the place whence you
removed them.” Pretty much as Girard used the
poor <span class='it'>operatives</span> does the public treat the man of genius.
Let him write the immortal sonnet, bright and beautiful,
to be fixed hereafter, a star in the firmament of
fame, and his contemporaries, in reply to his demand
for praise, will say, “What has he done? What
book has he written? What is he the author of?”—They
want to see work—honest labor, and plenty
of it, though that labor be as useless as the <span class='it'>toting</span> of
the bricks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not without some qualifications must these remarks
be considered strictly true, with regard to the present
age, or to our own country. There are facts
to the contrary, though not sufficient to disprove the
general truth of what we say. We have no poet,
who is more generally, or more highly esteemed,
than Halleck; and yet his truly great reputation has
been built up on some four or six short pieces of
verse. On the other hand, Mr. Sumner Lincoln Fairfield,
has lumbered the bookseller’s lofts with ream
after ream of printed paper, and nobody but an occasional
crazy reviewer, calls such a dunce, a poet.
Nevertheless, we maintain the verity of the general
observation, that those poets have heretofore been
most esteemed, who have done the most work. It is
downright astonishing, how much some of them did
<span class='it'>do</span>. We look over their long poems, with a sentiment
of wonder, and reverence, and we are awfully
perplexed to determine, how vast a length of time it
must have taken these modern Cheopses, to build
their pyramids. Hamlet’s account to Polonius, of
the graybeard’s book he was reading, appears to us
a pretty comprehensive description of many of these
vast metrical diffusions—“words, words, words.”
It exceeds our powers of conjecture, how the writers
could have completed their whole task, so labors the
line and so slow runs the verse. We have seen a
sturdy blacksmith pound a piece of iron, for hours
and hours, till it became as malleable as lead; we
have seen a woodsawyer saw, and saw, and saw, up
and down, down and up, till the very sight of him
made us ready to drop with imaginary fatigue; thy
still-beginning, never ending whirl, oh weary knife-grinder,
have we also contemplated with feverish
melancholy—still for the endurance of all these, have
we been able satisfactorily to account; drilled by
habit, ruled by habit, habit is to them a second nature.
But for the perpetration of a long, tedious
poem for the manufacture of verse after verse, the last
drier and duller than the preceding, there is no possible
manner of accounting. It is an infliction, which
can be borne by neither gods, men nor columns.
Your <span class='it'>médiocre</span> man may be forgiven for talking one
into a paralysis, or writing prose, till every word acts
like a mesmerist and puts you to sleep; but for his
writing verses, there can be, there ought to be no
forgiveness; he should be consigned to the cave of
perpetual oblivion, and over its entrance should be inscribed,
“Hope never enters here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Were we to follow in the track of reviewers in the
Quarterlies, who always seem to think it necessary
to make a considerable preliminary flourish to the
solemn common-places they are about to utter, we
should observe that the foregoing remarks had been
elicited by a work on our table, entitled “Imagination,
a poem in two parts, with other poems, by
Louisa Frances Poulter.” But as the work did not
call forth the remarks, we shall observe nothing of
the kind. The moment we wrote the title of the
poem, and saw that it consisted of nearly eleven
hundred lines, we began to reflect that very few long
poems had been written lately, and our pen scampered
over the paper at a rail-road rate, till we reached
the <span class='it'>dépôt</span> at the end of this paragraph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pausing here, we first look back over what we
have said; it pleases us—let it stand, therefore, and
let us now employ ourselves with reading Miss Poulter’s
poem in two cantos. We have not the slightest
dread of it—no! it seems a pleasant land, of which
we have had delightful glimpses in a transient survey.
With these glimpses we mean to entertain the reader,
besides giving him an idea of the face of the country.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>In limine</span>, we ought to confess ourselves amiable
critics, when we are called upon to pronounce on the
works of a female writer, and more particularly of
one who is a new claimant for distinction. It is our
desire to encourage the intellectual efforts of the
gentle sex, if for no better purpose, at least for that
of inciting women to assert their claims to the honors
and the rewards of authorship. These pages are
scrutinized by many a brilliant pair of eyes, ready to
flash indignation upon the slightest disparagement of
female genius. Far be it from us to evoke from
those mortal stars any other beams than those of
softness and serenity. Lovely readers! smile therefore
upon this article as kindly as upon the prettiest
story in the Magazine, and think well of him who
seeks to win no better guerdon than your approbation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Poulter has put upon her title-page a striking
passage in French from some essay of <span class='it'>Bernardin de
St. Pierre</span>, which may be thus literally translated.
“Tasso, while travelling with a friend, one day ascended
a very high mountain. When he had reached
the summit, he exclaimed: ‘Seest thou these rugged
rocks, these wild forests, this brook bordered with
flowers, which winds through the valley, this majestic
river, which rolls onward and onward till it
bathes the walls of a hundred cities? Well, these
rocks, these mountains, these walls, these cities,
gods, men—lo! these are my poem!’ ” On the page
immediately preceding the principal poem in the
volume, “Imagination,” there appears the following
from <span class='it'>Stewart’s Outlines of Moral Philosophy</span>, “One
of the principal effects of a liberal education is to
accustom us to withdraw our attention from the
objects of our present perceptions, and to dwell at
pleasure on the past, the absent and the future. How
much it must enlarge in this way the sphere of our
enjoyment or suffering is obvious: for (not to mention
the recollection of the past) all that part of our
happiness or misery, which arises from our hopes or
our fears, derives its existence entirely from the
power of our imagination.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are pleased with these quotations. They
augur well for the original words that are to follow.
They prepare the mind of the reader for something
almost as good as they are. The talent, or rather
tact of quoting well is no mean one; it is not possessed
by many, scarcely possessed at all by those
who say that a quotation should be as strictly appropriate
as a title. It is enough that a quotation be one
naturally appertaining to or suggestive <span class='it'>per se</span> of the
subject matter. Mottoes, it should be remembered,
are not texts, but simply prefixes, intended rather as
ornaments than things of use. They are to books,
chapters, and cantos, what jewels are to the clasps
of a fair lady’s girdle, not indispensable to the clasps,
but decorating them. In the choice of the jewels
and the style of their setting the taste of the wearer
is manifested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reflection which first suggests itself to us after
a consideration of this poem, is that the author preferred
rather to indulge her inclination for roving
from topic to topic, than to confine herself to any
exact method. She does not so much consider the
power of imagination or its effect upon life as she
does the places and persons upon which this faculty
of the mind would choose to expand itself. The
single word, therefore, which constitutes the title,
might be regarded as too pretensive, as demanding
too much, more than it is within the capacity or
education of the writer to give. Her modes of
thought seem to be too independent of the influence
of “Association,” and it would confuse a philosophical
thinker to follow the diversities of her fancy.
Perhaps, however, the person who reads only to be
amused, would derive more gratification from Miss
Poulter’s disregard of rules than were she more correct
and less fervid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The poem opens with a picture of sunset after a
storm, and this affords an apt and natural illustration
for the Power of the Imagination. The first topic
pursued is the fact that childhood is but little under
the influence of Imagination, being led away by the
pleasures of the present moment and apt to resign
itself wholly to the object by which it is temporarily
attracted. Illustrative of this is the following admirably
drawn scene⁠—</p>

<p class='line0'>But lo! one speckled wanderer lurks behind,</p>
<p class='line0'>’Mid the tall reeds that skirt the stream confined:</p>
<p class='line0'>It comes—it bites—he finds himself possest</p>
<p class='line0'>Of one small trout, less wary than the rest:</p>
<p class='line0'>With trembling hands he grasps his finny spoil,</p>
<p class='line0'>The rich reward of one long day of toil.</p>
<p class='line0'>For some short moments yet he keeps his seat</p>
<p class='line0'>Close to the brook, and laves his weary feet;</p>
<p class='line0'>Wide from his face his auburn locks he throws,</p>
<p class='line0'>That playful airs may fan his little brows;</p>
<p class='line0'>Then upward springs, and hums a blithesome lay,</p>
<p class='line0'>To cheat fatigue, and charm his lengthened way.</p>
<p class='line0'>Hark! while across the verdant lawn he skips,</p>
<p class='line0'>The half-told tale is muttered from his lips;</p>
<p class='line0'>With bounding heart he shows his spotted prize,</p>
<p class='line0'>And marks, exulting, the well-feigned surprise.</p>
<p class='line0'>A second moment sees him locked in sleep,</p>
<p class='line0'>And placid slumbers o’er his senses creep;</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the second Part or Canto, the following is a
brief analysis. The poet first addresses the Spirit of
Ruin; then displays various forms of destruction—a
shipwreck: the descent of an avalanche. The topics
next treated are intellectual decay; the fatal effects
of an ill-regulated and warm Imagination; the power
of Love in youth; the influence of Imagination in
our choice of life; the love of Fame; an active life
necessary to a person of vivid Imagination; the
thirst of some overcoming the love of life. Next
occurs an apostrophe to the noble and patriotic and
sainted spirits of the heroes of Switzerland and
America—Arnold de Winkelried and George Washington.
It is then shown that Imagination represents
them as still living; the power of Imagination
in old age is portrayed, and the poem concludes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From this part, we regret that we have room but
for two extracts; for these are of so excellent a
character that the reader, like Oliver Twist, will be
certain to ask for more.</p>

Alpine shepherd. The lines are eminently good.</p>

<p class='line0'>Rocks piled on rocks, and shagg’d with stunted pine;</p>
<p class='line0'>Yet touched with beauty, when the purple haze</p>
<p class='line0'>Its softening shadows o’er their summit lays;</p>
<p class='line0'>Then melts in air, while wandering sunbeams streak,</p>
<p class='line0'>With tints of rose, each ridge and frozen peak.</p>
<p class='line0'>From cliff to cliff hoarse cataracts pursue</p>
<p class='line0'>Their shattered course; now stained with lovely hue,</p>
<p class='line0'>Lovely, and yet more transient, while a ray</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the remarks, with which this article began,
it is clearly enough to be inferred that we are no
admirers of long poems, unless they be of extraordinary
and sustained merit. This praise cannot be
awarded to Miss Poulter’s production: We believe
that we have taken pretty much all that is excellent,
though a fine passage or two may be left in the exquisite
volume which we have just now cut to pieces—not
metaphorically, but literally. It was sad to
destroy so charming a library book; but what were
the exquisite typography and clear white paper of
one of Saunders &amp; Otley’s editions, when compared
with the amusement of the friends of Graham’s
Magazine? Nothing. Moreover, we should not
have quoted so largely as we have, had we not felt
assured of the fact that the volume to which we refer
was the only copy of Miss Poulter’s poem in America.
Such works are not in the least likely to be
reprinted here; and our readers would therefore
know nothing about them, were it not for the pains
we are happy to take in their behalf.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>A DASH AT A CONVOY.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was the second night after our brush with the
corvette, when a party, composed of Mr. St. Clair,
his niece and daughter, together with several of the
officers, stood at the side of the ship. It was a lovely
evening. The moon was high in heaven, sailing on
in cloudless splendor; her silvery light tipping the
tops of the billows, and stretching in a long line of
effulgence across the waters. A gentle breeze was
singing, with a clear musical intonation, among the
thousand tiny threads of the rigging. The water rippled
pleasantly against the sides of the ship. Not far
off lay a small rakish schooner, from which the
sound of a bugle, borne gently on the night air,
floated in delicious melody to our ears. The decks
were noiseless. The quiet moon seemed as if, by
some magic spell, she had hushed the deep into
silence, for scarcely a sound rose up from the heaving
waves, which, glittering now in the wake of the
moon, and now sinking into sudden shadow, stretched
away in the distance until they faded into the dim
mystic haze of the distant seaboard. The whole
scene was like a vision of romance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The group which I have mentioned stood at the
gangway of the ship. A boat was rocking gently
below. The passengers, whom we had rescued from
the brig, were about transferring themselves to the
schooner lying-to a short distance off, which we had
spoken about an hour before, and which proved to
be a small privateer bound in for Newport. As we
were off Block Island, and the run would consequently
be a short one, Mr. St. Clair had resolved
to avail himself of this opportunity to place his
daughter and niece safely on shore. The party were
now about to embark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall never forget your kindness,” said Mr. St.
Clair, addressing the captain, “and I am sure that
my daughter and niece will give you their especial
prayers, as the best return they can make for the
obligations they owe you. And as for my friend, Mr.
Cavendish—I hardly know how to express my
thanks. You will come and see us,” he continued,
turning frankly to me, and taking both my hands,
“Pomfret Hall will always open its doors gladly to
welcome the preserver of its owner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I promised that I would not forget it, and turned
away to hide the emotion occasioned by the kind
tone of Mr. St. Clair. As I moved away my eyes
fell on Annette. Her gaze was fixed on me with an
expression I shall never forget, but which I would
have given the world to have been able to interpret.
There was an expression of the deepest interest in
that look, and the eyes, I fancied, were partially
humid. As soon as she caught my gaze, she blushed
deeply, and looked down. What meant that earnest
gaze—this sudden embarrassment? Did she then
really love me? My heart beat fast, my brain fairly
swam around, my emotion, for an instant, almost
overpowered me. I could, if no one had been present,
have rushed to her feet and told my suit. But
a moment’s reflection changed the current of my
thoughts. Perhaps she had noticed my feelings while
her father had been speaking. If so, her subsequent
emotion arose from being detected in observing me.
I ran over everything which had happened since she
had been on board, and could find nothing corroborating,
directly, the idea that she loved me. Her
manner had always been frank and kind; but what
had she said or done to give me hope? As these
thoughts rushed through my mind my towering
hopes fell. The revulsion was extreme. I despaired
now as much as I had exulted but a moment before.
I was about to turn gloomily away, when the voice
of Isabel called me. I looked up. She was beckoning
me gayly toward her as she leaned on Annette’s
arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I declare, Mr. Cavendish,” she said laughingly,
“you seem to be determined to leave us depart
without even saying ‘adieu’—a pretty gallant you
are, to be sure! Here is Annette really displeased at
your coldness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A look of silent reproach was the only reply of
her cousin, who dared not raise her eyes to mine.
With the vacillation of a lover my sentiments again
underwent a change. Had Annette really been wondering
at my coldness? How unjust then had been
my suspicions. I advanced eagerly to her side. Yet
when I had done so I knew not what to say. Isabel
seemed not only to see my embarrassment but to
enjoy it. She continued gayly—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, now, do your <span class='it'>devoir</span> like a gallant knight
and soldier—coz, have you no glove or other favor
for him to wear on his bosom in battle? Ah! me,
the days of courtesy and chivalry have gone forever.
But there I see uncle ordering down my package, I
must see that he does not let it drop clumsily over-board,”
and she tripped laughingly away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Left almost <span class='it'>tête-à-tête</span> with Annette—for every eye
was that moment turned to the gangway where some
of the passengers were already embarking, I yet
felt unable to avail myself of an opportunity for
which I had longed. A single word would decide
my fate, and yet that word I could not pronounce.
My boldness had all disappeared, and I stood before
that fair girl equally agitated with herself. At length
I looked up. She stole a furtive glance at me as I
did so, and blushed again to the very brow. I took
her hand, it was not withdrawn. Words of fire were
already on my lips when her father turned toward
us, saying—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Annie, my love, they wait for you—Mr. Cavendish,
a last good-bye”—and as he spoke every eye
was turned toward us. The precious moment was
past. I could do nothing but lead Annette forward.
Yet I ventured to press her hand. My senses deceived
me, or it was faintly, though very faintly, returned.
I would have given worlds, if I had them, for the
delay of a minute, that I might learn my fate from
the lips of that fair girl. But it was not to be. We
were already in the centre of the group. Mr. St.
Clair took his daughter and lifted her into the chair,
and in another moment her white dress fluttered in
its descent to the boat. My heart died within me.
The golden moment had passed, perhaps forever;
for when should we meet again? New scenes, new
friends would in all probability drive me from Annette’s
remembrance before we should next see each
other. These thoughts filled my mind as I leaned
over the bulwark and waved my hand while the
boat put off. Mr. St. Clair stood up in the barge and
bowed in return, while I thought I could see, through
the shadowy moonlight, the fair hand of Annette
returning my parting adieus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I watched the receding figures until they reached
the schooner, and even after they had ascended the
deck, and the two vessels had parted each on its
own way, I continued gazing on the white dress of
Annette until I could no longer detect the faintest
shadow of it. When at length it disappeared totally
in the distance, I felt a loneliness of the heart, such
as no language can express. To a late hour I continued
pensively walking the deck, unable to shake
off this feeling, and it was only a gay remark of one
of my messmates that finally aroused me from my
abstraction. I shook off my pensiveness by an effort,
laughed gayly in reply, and soon sought my hammock,
as my spirits would not permit me much
longer to carry on this double game.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a week we cruized in the track of the homeward
bound fleet from the West Indies, but without
success. During this time Annette was constantly
in my thoughts. Her last look—that gentle pressure
of her hand thrilled through every vein, as often as
they recurred to me. Never could I forget her—would
she continue to think of me?</p>

<p class='pindent'>More than a week had passed, as I have said,
since we had parted from the St. Clairs, yet still we
had not spoken a sail. At length one day, when I
had the morning watch, the lookout hailed from the
cross-trees, that a sail was down on the seaboard to
leeward. Chase was instantly given to the stranger.
The breeze was fresh, and we were in consequence
soon close enough to discern the character of our
neighbor. She had not from the first appeared to
avoid us, and no sooner did we show our colors,
than she ran up the ensign of France. We were
going on different tacks, and, as we approached, both
ships lay-to for a moment’s conversation. The
French merchantman was a noble ship, and as she
came up gallantly towards us, her long bowsprit
sunk far down into the trough of the wave, and then,
with a slow swan-like motion she rose on the ensuing
swell until her bows were elevated almost clear
of the water, while the bright copper dripping with
brine glistened gloriously in the sunbeams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Frenchman backed his topsails as he drew
near, and the two vessels stood head on, while we
sent a boat on board. The merchantman proved to
be upon her homeward passage, and had consequently
no intelligence from Europe to furnish us.
But the French skipper told us what was far more
interesting to us. He mentioned that he had, but the
day before, fallen in with the homeward bound English
fleet, from the West Indies, amounting to some
sixty sail. The fleet was convoyed by four men-of-war.
Our captain, however, resolved to have a dash
at the convoy. He conceived the daring project of
cutting off a portion of the fleet, under the very batteries
of the men-of-war. The French skipper wished
us a “<span class='it'>bon voyage</span>,” and the two vessels parted
company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We cracked on all sail, during the whole of the day
and night. The next morning, at the dawn of day,
our lookout descried the English fleet, on our larboard-side.
Luckily, we had the weather-gauge. We
kept crowding on our canvass, however, during the
whole forenoon, and as we gained on the convoy,
we saw sail after sail rising in the seaboard, until
the whole horizon was dotted with them, and the
lookout reported more than fifty, in sight. By this
the men-of-war had caught the alarm, and were
firing guns to keep their flock around them. The
dull sailers, however, fell rapidly behind. This forced
one of the English frigates to leave the advance, and
run astern of the fleet. During the whole day we
kept coquetting to windward of the fleet, but no demonstrations
against us were made on the part of the
men-of-war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A cowardly set, by the Lord Harry,” said our old
boatswain, who often beguiled a dull hour with a
yarn, “here are we giving them a chance for a fair
stand-up fight, and the cowardly lubbers haven’t the
pluck to come up and take or give a thrashing. I
can’t stand such sneaking scoundrels—by St. George,”
and the old fellow energetically squirted a stream of
tobacco-juice from his mouth, as if from a force-pump.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll have a brush with them, nevertheless,
Hinton,” said I, “or I know nothing of the captain.
He has got his eye on more than one rich prize in
that fleet, and depend upon it, he’ll make a dash for
it before long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay! ay! you’re right,” answered the boatswain
“and he’ll do it, too, before two bells have struck
in the morning watch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night shut in squally and dark. The fleet was
some three miles to leeward, for during the whole
day we had carefully maintained the weather gauge.
As the darkness increased we lost sight of the enemy’s
ships, but their numerous lights glistening like
stars along the seaboard, still pointed out to us their
position. The wind was uncertain, now coming in
fitful puffs, and then blowing steadily for a quarter
of an hour, when it would again die away and sweep
in squalls across the waste of waters. Scud clouds
began to fly across the face of the heavens, obscuring
the few stars, and giving a wild and ominous appearance
to the firmament. Down to the west the
seaboard was covered by a dense bank of clouds, out
of which occasionally a flash of lightning would zig-zag,
followed by a low hoarse growl of distant thunder.
It was evident that a tempest was raging, far
down in that quarter. On the opposite horizon,
however, the sky was nearly free from clouds, only
a few fleecy vapors being discernible in that quarter,
through which the bright stars twinkled clear and
lustrous. The English fleet lay between these two
opposite quarters of the horizon—the right wing of
the convoy stretching down almost into the utter
darkness in that direction, and the left wing skirting
along the horizon to the eastward. Along the whole
expanse of seaboard, more than fifty lights were now
glittering, like so many fire-flies winging through the
gloom along the edge of a forest, on a summer eve.
The scene was one of surpassing novelty, and drew
forth the admiration even of our veteran tars. Now
and then the vapors in the east would clear entirely
away, leaving the firmament in that direction, sparkling
with thousands of stars; and then again the
murky shroud would enclose them in nearly total
darkness. Occasionally, as if in contrast to this, a
brighter flash of lightning would gleam, or a louder
burst of thunder roll up from the dark bank of clouds
enclosing the tempest to the westward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night had scarcely settled down before the
ship’s course was altered and we bore down upon
the fleet—taking the precaution, however, to put out
all the lights on board except the one at the binnacle.
Meantime the men were called to quarters,
the tompions of the guns removed, the ammunition
served out, pikes, cutlasses and fire arms distributed
among the crew, and every preparation made for
action. As we drew nearer to the convoy the darkness
of the night increased, until, at length, we
could see but a few fathoms ahead into the gloom.
The eastern firmament now became wholly obscured.
Not a star shone on high to guide us on our
way. Had it not been for the long line of lights
sparkling along the seaboard, betraying the positions
occupied by the various vessels in the convoy, we
should have possessed no guide to our prey,—and
nothing but the confidence felt by the enemy in his
superior force could have induced him to continue
his lights aboard, when otherwise he might have run
a chance of dropping us in the darkness. But he
never dreamed of the bold swoop which we projected,
into the very midst of his flock. He would as
soon have thought of our blockading the Thames, or
burning the English fleet at Portsmouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The plan of Captain Smythe was indeed a bold
one. Bearing right onwards into the very centre of
the fleet, he intended to cut off one of the wings
from the main body, and then board and take possession
of as many of the merchantmen as he could
carry in the obscurity. We judged that the men-of-war
were in the van, with the exception of a frigate
which we had seen before nightfall hovering in the
rear of the fleet to cover the lagging merchantmen.
This frigate, however, we supposed to be on the
extreme right of the enemy. We therefore bore
down for the opposite extremity of the fleet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For more than an hour, while, with every rag of
canvass abroad, we were hastening to overtake the
enemy, scarcely a word was spoken by the crew,—but
each man remained at his station eagerly watching
the gradual diminution of the distance betwixt
us and the convoy. Indeed silence was, in some
measure, necessary to the success of our plot. Even
the orders of the officers therefore were given and
executed with as little bustle as possible. As the
darkness increased we noticed that the lights ahead
began to diminish in number, and it was not long
before we became satisfied that the foe had at length
awoke to the probability of our being in the vicinity.
At length scarcely more than half a dozen lights
could be seen. These we judged to belong to the
men-of-war, being kept aloft for the convoy to steer
by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The difficulty of our enterprise was now redoubled,
for, if the darkness should increase, there would be
great danger of a collision with one or another of the
fleet. This peril, however, we shared in common
with the merchantmen composing the convoy. Our
only precaution consisted in doubling our look-outs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another hour passed, during which we steered by
the lights of the men-of-war. By the end of that
period we had run, according to our calculation, into
the very heart of the fleet, leaving a man-of-war
broad on our larboard beam, a mile or two distant.
This latter vessel we fancied to be the frigate which
had been hovering towards nightfall in the rear of
the fleet. Our anxiety now increased. We were
surrounded, on every side, by the vessels of the convoy,
and the obscurity was so profound that we could
not see a pistol shot on any hand. Our progress,
meantime, was continued in utter silence. The only
sound we heard was the singing of the wind through
the rigging, the occasional cheeping of a block, or
the rushing of the water along our sides. Suddenly,
however, I thought I heard a sound as of the bracing
of a yard right over our starboard bow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hist!” I said to the boatswain, who happened
that moment to be passing, “hist! do you hear
that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old fellow stopped, listened a moment, and
then shaking his head, said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hear nothing. What did <span class='it'>you</span> hear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hark! there it goes again,” I said, as the sound
of a sail flapping against a mast came distinctly out
of the gloom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By St. George, you are right,” exclaimed the old
water-rat, “ay! ay! young ears are arter-all the
sharpest!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had scarcely spoken before the tall masts of a
ship, like a spectre rising through the night, lifted
themselves up out of the obscurity in the direction
whence the sound had proceeded, and instantaneously
we heard the tramping of many feet on the decks of
the stranger, the rapid orders of the officers, the running
of ropes, the creaking of yards, and the dull
flapping of sails in the wind. At the same time a
voice hailed,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Luff up or you’ll be into us,” and then the same
voice spoke as if addressing the helmsman on board
the stranger, “up with your helm—around, around
with her—my God! we’ll be afoul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The consternation of the British skipper was not
without cause. No sooner had Capt. Smythe discovered
our proximity to the stranger, than he formed
the determination of running her aboard, taking her
by a sally of our brave fellows, and then, after
throwing into her a party sufficiently strong to maintain
possession of her, keeping on his way. During
the minute therefore that elapsed betwixt the discovery
of the merchantman, and the hail of her affrighted
skipper, the boarders had been called away and
the quartermaster ordered to run us bows on to the
quarter of the stranger. Instead of luffing, therefore,
we kept straight on in our course, and as a score of
lanterns were instantly shown on board both ships,
sufficient light was thrown over the scene to guide
us in our manœuvre. As the English ship wore
around, bringing the wind on her starboard quarter,
our helm was jammed to port, and swinging around
almost on our heel we shot upon the foe, striking her
in the stern galley, which we crushed as we would
have crushed an egg-shell. The English ship was
heavily loaded, and in consequence our bowsprit ran
high above her decks, affording a bridge on which
our brave tars might easily pass on board. At the
moment we struck, the captain dashed forward, and
summoning the boarders to follow him, had leaped,
sword in hand, into the centre of the enemy’s
crew, before her skipper had ceased giving orders to
the perplexed seamen, who were running to and fro
on her decks, in the vain hope of preventing any
damage resulting to them from this collision, with, as
they thought, a sister vessel. The consternation of
the master may well be conceived when he found
his ship in possession of an enemy. For some
minutes he imagined it to be a jest, for he could not
conceive how any foe would have the audacity to
cut him out from the very heart of the fleet. His
rueful countenance when he discovered his error, I
shall never forget, nor the bad grace with which he
consented to be transferred with a portion of his men
to <span class='sc'>the Aurora</span>. In less than five minutes, however,
this necessary precaution had been carried into effect,
and a prize-crew left in possession of the merchantman.
The officer in command was ordered to haul
out of the fleet, and gain a position as speedily as
possible to windward. Then the two ships were
parted, and we stood away as before on the larboard
tack, while the prize braced sharp up, hauled
her bowlines, and went off close into the wind’s
eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Jove,” said a reefer, elated with the part he
had acted among the boarders, for he had been one
of the first to step on the decks of the merchantman,
“by Jupiter, but that was neatly done—eh! don’t
you think so, Hinton, my old boy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut your dead-lights, you young jackanapes,”
growled the old boatswain, by no means pleased with
such a salutation, “and keep your tongue for cheering
against the enemy: you’ll have enough of it to do
yet before you turn in. Avast! there! I say,” he
continued, perceiving that the youngster was about
to interrupt him, “go to your post, or I’ll report you,
you young whelp. None of your blarney, as your
thick-tongued Irish messmate would say—away with
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Hinton’s ire was up the safest plan was to
retreat, for he would brook no retort unless from the
captain or lieutenant. Over the young reefers,
especially those who were in disfavor with him, he
domineered with a rod of iron. The youngster who
had forgotten for a moment, in the elation of his first
victory, the awe in which he held the boatswain, was
recalled by these words to a sense of the authority of
the old tar, and he shrunk accordingly away, disdaining
to reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay! go, you varmint,” chuckled Hinton, as the
reefer walked to his post, “and give none of your
long shore palaver to a man who had learned before
you were born to hold his tongue before an enemy
as his first duty. Isn’t it so, Mr. Cavendish?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was a great favorite of the old fellow, and always
made a point of humoring him, so I nodded an assent
to his remark, although I was tempted to ask him
how long since he had forgotten this important duty
of silence. I restrained, however, my question, and
the smile which would fain have preceded it: and
listened for several minutes in return for this complaisance
to a long philippic on the part of the old
fellow, against what he chose to call the almost
universal presumption of midshipmen. From this
tirade, however, the boatswain condescended to exempt
me. How long he would have dilated upon
this favorite subject, I know not; but, at this moment,
a hail came out of the gloom ahead, and every eye
was instantly attracted in the direction from which
the voice proceeded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ship ahoy!” shouted a herculean voice, “what
craft is that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tone of the speaker betrayed a latent suspicion
that all was not right with us. Indeed he must have
been so close to us in our late encounter with the
merchantman, that he necessarily heard many things
to awaken his doubts. As he spoke, too, the tall
figure of a heavy craft loomed out from the obscurity,
and while we were yet speculating as to the answer
the captain would make, a dozen lanterns flashing
through as many open port-holes, revealed that our
neighbor was a man-of-war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What ship is that?” thundered the voice again,
“answer, or I’ll fire into you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our dauntless captain waved his hand for the batteries
to be unmasked, and springing into the mizzen
rigging, while a neighboring battle-lantern now disclosed
to the night, flung its light full upon his form,
he shouted in an equally stentorian voice⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is <span class='sc'>the Aurora</span>—commissioned by the good
commonwealth of⁠——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give it to the canting rebel,” roared the British
officer, breaking in on this reply, “fire—for God and
St. George—<span style='font-size:smaller'>FIRE</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay! fire my brave boys,” thundered our leader,
“one and all, for the old thirteen—<span style='font-size:smaller'>FIRE</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the moment when the enemy had disclosed
his lighted ports, our gallant tars had been waiting,
like hounds in the leash, for the signal which was to
let them loose upon the foe. The silent gesture of
the captain, when he sprung into the mizzen rigging,
had been intuitively understood by the crew, and the
orders of the proper officers were scarcely waited for,
before the ports were opened, the battle lanterns unmasked,
the guns run out, and the whole deck
changed, as if by magic, from a scene of almost
Egyptian darkness to one of comparative light. Nor
were the men less ready to discover the moment
when to open their fire. The first word of the British
officer’s haughty interruption had scarcely been spoken,
when the gunners began to pat their pieces and squint
knowingly along them, so that, when the command
to fire was given, our whole broadside went off at
once, like a volcano, and with deadly effect. Every
gun had been accurately aimed, every shot was sent
crashing into the foe. Not so the enemy. Although
the British captain had certainly viewed us with
suspicion, his crew had apparently thought us deserving
of little caution; and the reply of our leader,
and the order of their own to fire, took them, after all,
with surprise. Nearly a minute accordingly elapsed
before they delivered their broadside, and then it was
done hurriedly and with little certainty of aim. The
first fire is always more effective than the ensuing
six; and the advantage of the surprise was decided;
for while we could hear the crashing of timbers, and
the shrieks of the wounded, following our discharge,
the shot of the enemy passed mostly over our heads,
and, in my vicinity, not a man of our crew was killed.
One poor fellow, however, fell wounded at the gun
next to mine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huzza!” roared Hinton, leaping like a lion to fill
the place of the injured man, “they’ve got their
grog already. Have at ’em, my brave fellows, again,
and revenge your messmate. Never mind, Jack,”
he said, turning to the bleeding man, “every one
must have a kick sometime in his life, and the sooner
its over, my hearty, the better. Bouse her out, shipmates!
Huzza for old Nantucket—the varmints have
it again on full allowance!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For ten minutes the fight was maintained on our
side without cessation. The enemy, at first, rallied
and attempted to return our broadsides promptly, but
the injuries she had suffered from our first discharge
had disheartened her men, and, when they found the
spirit with which we maintained our fire, they soon
gave up the contest and deserted their arms. Still,
however, the enemy did not strike. One or two of
her forward guns were occasionally and suddenly
discharged at us, but all systematic resistance had
ceased in less than five minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time, however, the whole fleet was in an
uproar. Lights were dashing in every quarter of the
horizon, and, as the darkness had been clearing
away since our brush with the merchantman, our
lookout aloft could see through the faint, misty distance,
more than one vessel bearing down toward
us. The majority, however, of the fleet, seemed to
be struck with a complete panic, and, like a flock of
startled partridges, were hurrying from us in every
direction. It soon became apparent that the ships,
bearing down upon us, were armed; and before we
had been engaged ten minutes with our antagonist,
no less than three men-of-war, from as many quarters
of the horizon, had opened a concentric fire on
us, regardless of the damage they would do their
consort. Still, however, unwilling to leave his antagonist
without compelling her to strike, our leader
maintained his position and poured in a series of
rapid broadsides which cut the foe up fearfully. Yet
she would not strike. On the other hand, reanimated
by the approach of her consorts, her men rallied to
her guns and began again to reply to our broadsides.
Meanwhile the hostile frigates were coming up to
us, hand over hand, increasing the rapidity of their
cannonade as the distance betwixt us lessened. Our
situation was becoming momentarily more critical.
Yet even amid our peril my eye was attracted by the
sublimity of the scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night, I have said, had partially cleared away,
but the darkness was still sufficiently intense to render
the approaching frigates but dimly visible, except
when a gush of fire would stream from their ports,
lighting up, for the moment, with a ghastly glare,
the smoke-encircled hull, the tall masts, and the
thousand mazes of the hamper. Often the whole
three vessels would discharge their broadsides at
once, when it would seem for an instant as if we were
girdled by fire. Then, as the smoke settled on their
decks, they would disappear wholly from our sight,
and only become again distinguishable, when they
belched forth their sulphureous flame once more. In
the west, the scene was even more magnificent, for
in that quarter, was unexpectedly the nearest of the
three men-of-war, and as she came up to us close-hauled,
she yawed whenever she fired, and then
steadily discharged her pieces, doing more damage
than all her other consorts. The gallant manner in
which she delivered her fire—the measured, distinct
booming of her long twenty-fours—and more than
all, the inky hue of the sky, in the background,
brought out into the boldest relief, by the light of her
guns, made up a picture of gloomy grandeur, which
the imagination can compare to nothing, except the
fitful, ghastly gleams of light shooting across the darkness
of that infernal realm, which Dante has painted
with his pen of horror. While, however, I was
gazing awe-struck, on this scene, I noticed that the
dark bank of clouds behind the frigate, was visibly
in motion, rolling up towards us. Our superior officer
had, perhaps, noticed the same phenomenon, and
knowing what it portended, had remained by his antagonist,
when otherwise, our only chance of escape
would have been in an early flight. Some of the
older tars now perceived the approaching tempest,
and paused instantaneously from the combat. Indeed,
not a moment was to be lost. I had scarcely
time to look once more in the direction of the other
frigates, and then turn again to the westward, before
our antagonist in that quarter, was completely shut
in by the squall. The wind had, meantime, died
away, leaving us rocking unquietly in the swell. A
pause of a minute ensued, a pause of the most breathless
suspense. The men had instinctively left their
guns, and stood awaiting the directions of their leaders
to whom they looked in this emergency. We were
happily nearly before the wind, which could now be
seen lashing the foam from the billows, and driving
down upon us with the speed of a race-horse. Another
instant and the squall would be upon us. All
this, however, had passed, in less time than is occupied
in the relation, for scarcely a minute had elapsed,
since I first saw the approaching squall, before
Captain Smythe shouted,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stand by to clew down—quick there all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The command was not an instant too soon. His
opening words were heard distinctly in the boding
calm that preceded the squall, but the concluding
sentence was lost in the hissing and roaring of the
hurricane that now swept across our decks. The
captain saw that it was useless to attempt to speak
in the uproar, and waving his hand for the quartermaster
to keep her away, while the men instinctively
clewed down the topsail-yards, and hauled out the
reef-tackles, he awaited the subsidence of the squall.
For five minutes we went skimming before the tempest,
like a snow-flake in a storm. On—on—on, we
drove, the fine spray hissing past us on the gale, and
the shrill scream of the wind through our hamper
deafening our ears. Whither we were going, or
what perils might meet us in our mad career, we
knew not. We were flying helplessly onward, enclosed
by the mist, at the mercy of the winds. Even
if the intensity of the squall would have allowed us
to bring by the wind and reef, prudence would dictate
that we should run before the hurricane, as the
only chance of escaping from the clutches of our
foes. Yet, surrounded as we were by the merchantmen
of the fleet, we knew not but the next moment,
we might run down some luckless craft, and perhaps
by the collision, sink both them and ourselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For nearly half an hour we drove thus before the
hurricane. More than once we fancied that we
heard the shrieks of drowning men, rising high over
all the uproar of the tempest, but whether they were
in reality the cries of the dying or only the sounds
created by an overheated imagination and having no
existence except in the brain of the hearer, God
only knows! A thousand ships might have sunk
within a cable’s length of us, and not a prayer of the
sufferers, not a shriek of despair have met our ears.
There was a fearfulness in that palpable darkness,
which struck the most veteran heart with an awe
akin to fear. When men can look abroad and see
the real extent of the peril which surrounds them
they can dare almost anything; but when surrounded
by darkness their imaginations conjure up dangers
in every strange intonation of the tempest, in every
new outbreak of the surge. They tremble at what
they cannot behold; in the language of the scripture
“their joints are loosed with fear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length the fury of the squall began to subside,
and the dark bank of clouds which had encircled us,
undulated, rolled to and fro, and finally flew in ragged
vapors away, flitting wildly past the stars that
once more twinkled in the sky. As the prospect
brightened, we looked eagerly around to see what
damage the squall had occasioned. The fleet was
scattered hither and thither over the horizon, torn,
shattered, dismantled, powerless. Far up in the
quarter from whence the hurricane had burst could
be faintly seen the body of the convoy; but on every
hand around some of the less fortunate ships were
discoverable. Whether, however, most of the merchantmen
had attempted to lie-to, or whether we
had scudded before the gale with a velocity which
none could rival, it was evident that we had passed
away like a thunderbolt from the rest of the fleet,
leaving them at a hopeless distance astern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Owing to the rapidity with which our canvass had
been got in, we suffered no material injury; and,
when the gale subsided and the wind came out
again from the north, we lost no time in hauling up
and getting the weather-gauge of the convoy. The
ship was put once more in trim—the crew then
turned in, and the watches were left in undisturbed
possession of the decks. As I stood at my post and
watched the bright stars overhead, shining placidly
upon me, or listened to the cry of “All’s well!”
passed from lookout to lookout across the deck, I
could not help contrasting the peace and silence of
the scene with the fearful uproar of the preceding
hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When morning dawned, not a vestige of the fleet
remained on the southern seaboard. Our anxiety
was now turned to the fate of the merchantman we
had captured and that of the prize-crew we had
thrown into her. But toward the afternoon watch,
a sail was discovered on the horizon to windward,
and when we had approached within a proper distance
we recognized our prize. Our joy at rejoining
may well be imagined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prize proved to be laden with a valuable cargo,
and, as this was the first capture of any moment we
had made, it raised the spirits of the men in a commensurate
degree. The skipper of the merchantman
could never comprehend the justice of his capture.
Like the generals whom Napoleon has been beating
at a later day, he protested that he had been taken
against all the rules of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After keeping company with us for a few days, the
prize hauled up for the coast with the intention of
going into Newport. We subsequently learned that
she accomplished her aim, but not until she had run
the gauntlet of an English fleet. As for ourselves,
we stood towards the south on the look out for a new
prize.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Charles O’Malley, The Irish Dragoon. By Harry Lorrequer.
With Forty Illustrations by Phiz. Complete in
One Volume. Carey &amp; Hart: Philadelphia.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The first point to be observed in the consideration of
“Charles O’Malley” is the great <span class='it'>popularity</span> of the work.
We believe that in this respect it has surpassed even the
inimitable compositions of Mr. Dickens. At all events it
has met with a most extensive sale; and, although the
graver journals have avoided its discussion, the ephemeral
press has been nearly if not quite unanimous in its praise.
To be sure, the commendation, although unqualified, cannot
be said to have abounded in specification, or to have been,
in any regard, of a satisfactory character to one seeking
precise ideas on the topic of the book’s particular merit. It
appears to us, in fact, that the cabalistical words “fun,”
“rollicking” and “devil-may-care,” if indeed words they
be, have been made to stand in good stead of all critical
comment in the case of the work now under review. We
first saw these dexterous expressions in a fly-leaf of
“Opinions of the Press” appended to the renowned
“Harry Lorrequer” by his publisher in Dublin. Thence
transmitted, with complacent echo, from critic to critic,
through daily, weekly and monthly journals without number,
they have come at length to form a pendant and a portion
of our author’s celebrity—have come to be regarded as
sufficient response to the few ignoramuses who, obstinate
as ignorant, and fool-hardy as obstinate, venture to propound
a question or two about the true claims of “Harry
Lorrequer” or the justice of the pretensions of “Charles
O’Malley.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We shall not insult our readers by supposing any one of
them unaware of the fact, that a book may be even exceedingly
<span class='it'>popular</span> without <span class='it'>any</span> legitimate literary merit. This
fact can be proven by numerous examples which, now and
here, it will be unnecessary and perhaps indecorous to
mention. The dogma, then, is absurdly false, that the
popularity of a work is <span class='it'>primâ facie</span> evidence of its excellence
in some respects; that is to say, the dogma is false if
we confine the meaning of excellence (as here of course it
must be confined) to excellence in a literary sense. The
truth is, that the popularity of a book is <span class='it'>primâ facie</span> evidence
of just the converse of the proposition—it is evidence
of the book’s <span class='it'>demerit</span>, inasmuch as it shows a “stooping to
conquer”—inasmuch as it shows that the author has dealt
largely, if not altogether, in matters which are susceptible
of appreciation by the mass of mankind—by uneducated
thought, by uncultivated taste, by unrefined and unguided
passion. So long as the world retains its present point of
civilization, so long will it be almost an axiom that no extensively
<span class='it'>popular</span> book, in the right application of the term,
can be a work of high merit, <span class='it'>as regards those particulars of
the work which are popular</span>. A book may be readily sold,
may be universally read, for the sake of some half or two-thirds
of its matter, which half or two-thirds may be susceptible
of popular appreciation, while the one-half or one-third
remaining may be the delight of the highest intellect
and genius, and absolute <span class='it'>caviare</span> to the rabble. And just as</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>so will the writer of fiction, who looks most sagaciously to
his own <span class='it'>interest</span>, combine all votes by intermingling with
his loftier efforts such amount of less ethereal matter as
will give general currency to his composition. And here
we shall be pardoned for quoting some observations of the
English artist, H. Howard. Speaking of <span class='it'>imitation</span>, he
says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>The pleasure which results from it, even when employed
upon the most ordinary materials, will always render that
property of our art the most attractive with the majority,
because it may be enjoyed with the least mental exertion.
<span class='it'>All</span> men are in some degree judges of it. The cobbler in his
own line may criticize Apelles; and popular opinions are
never to be wholly disregarded concerning that which is
addressed to the public—who, to a certain extent, are generally
right; although as the language of the refined can
never be intelligible to the uneducated, so the higher styles
of art can never be acceptable to the multitude. In proportion
as a work rises in the scale of intellect, it must necessarily
become limited in the number of its admirers. For
this reason the judicious artist, even in his loftiest efforts,
will endeavor to introduce some of those qualities which
are interesting to all, as a passport for those of a more intellectual
character.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And these remarks upon painting—remarks which are
mere truisms in themselves—embody nearly the whole
<span class='it'>rationale</span> of the topic now under discussion. It may be
added, however, that the <span class='it'>skill</span> with which the author addresses
the lower taste of the populace, is often a source of
pleasure because of admiration, to a taste higher and more
refined, and may be made a point of comment and of commendation
by the critic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In our review, last month, of “Barnaby Rudge,” we
were prevented, through want of space, from showing how
Mr. Dickens had so well succeeded in uniting all suffrages.
What we have just said, however, will suffice upon this
point. While he has appealed, in innumerable regards, to
the most exalted intellect, he has meanwhile invariably
touched a certain string whose vibrations are omni-prevalent.
We allude to his powers of <span class='it'>imitation</span>—that species
of imitation to which Mr. Howard has reference—the <span class='it'>faithful</span>
depicting of what is called still-life, and particularly of
<span class='it'>character</span> in humble condition. It is his close observation
and imitation of nature here which have rendered him
popular, while his higher qualities, with the ingenuity
evinced in addressing the general taste, have secured him
the good word of the informed and intellectual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this is an important point upon which we desire to
be distinctly understood. We wish here to record our positive
dissent (be that dissent worth what it may) from a
very usual opinion—the opinion that Mr. Dickens has done
justice to his own genius—that any man ever failed to do
grievous wrong to his own genius—in appealing to the
popular judgment <span class='it'>at all</span>. As a matter of pecuniary policy
alone, is any such appeal defensible. But we speak, of
course, in relation to fame—in regard to that</p>

<div class='blockquote'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;——spur which the true spirit doth raise</p>
<p class='line0'>To scorn delight and live laborious days.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That a perfume should be found by any “true spirit” in
the incense of mere popular applause, is, to our own apprehension
at least, a thing inconceivable, inappreciable,—a
paradox which gives the lie unto itself—a mystery more
profound than the well of Democritus. Mr. Dickens has no
more business with the rabble than a seraph with a <span class='it'>chapeau
de bras</span>. What’s Hecuba to him or he to Hecuba? What
is he to Jacques Bonhomme<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a> or Jacques Bonhomme to him?
The higher genius is a rare gift and divine. Ὡπόλλων
ου παντι φαεινεται, ος μιν ιδη, μεγας ουτος—not to all men Apollo
shows himself; <span class='it'>he</span> is <span class='it'>alone great</span> who beholds him.<a id='r4'/><a href='#f4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a> And
his greatness has its office God-assigned. But that office is
not a low communion with low, or even with ordinary intellect.
The holy—the electric spark of genius is the
medium of intercourse between the noble and more noble
mind. For lesser purposes there are humbler agents.
There are puppets enough, able enough, willing enough, to
perform in literature the little things to which we have
had reference. For one Fouqué there are fifty Molières.
For one Angelo there are five hundred Jan Steens. For one
Dickens there are five million Smolletts, Fieldings, Marryatts,
Arthurs, Cocktons, Bogtons and Frogtons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is, in brief, the duty of all whom circumstances have
led into criticism—it is, at least, a duty from which <span class='it'>we</span> individually
shall never shrink—to uphold the true dignity
of genius, to combat its degradation, to plead for the exercise
of its powers in those bright fields which are its legitimate
and peculiar province, and which for it alone lie
gloriously outspread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to return to “Charles O’Malley,” and its popularity.
We have endeavored to show that this latter must not be
considered in any degree as the measure of its merit, but
should rather be understood as indicating a deficiency in
this respect, when we bear in mind, as we should do, the
highest aims of intellect in fiction. A slight examination of
the work, (for in truth it is worth no more,) will sustain us
in what we have said. The plot is exceedingly meagre.
Charles O’Malley, the hero, is a young orphan Irishman,
living in Galway county, Ireland, in the house of his uncle,
Godfrey, to whose sadly encumbered estates the youth is
heir apparent and presumptive. He becomes enamoured,
while on a visit to a neighbor, of Miss Lucy Dashwood, and
finds a rival in a Captain Hammersley. Some words
carelessly spoken by Lucy, inspire him with a desire for
military renown. After sojourning, therefore, for a brief
period, at Dublin University, he obtains a commission and
proceeds to the Peninsula, with the British army under
Wellington. Here he distinguishes himself; is promoted;
and meets frequently with Miss Dashwood, whom obstinately,
and in spite of the lady’s own acknowledgment of
love for himself, he supposes in love with Hammersley.
Upon the storming of Ciudad Rodrigo he returns home;
finds his uncle, of course, <span class='it'>just</span> dead; and sells his commission
to disencumber the estate. Presently Napoleon escapes
from Elba, and our hero, obtaining a staff appointment under
Picton, returns to the Peninsula, is present at Waterloo,
(where Hammersley is killed) saves the life of Lucy’s father,
for the second time, as he has already twice saved that of
Lucy herself; is rewarded by the hand of the latter; and,
making his way back to O’Malley Castle, “lives happily
all the rest of his days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In and about this plot (if such it may be called) there are
more absurdities than we have patience to enumerate.
The author, or narrator, for example, is supposed to be
Harry Lorrequer as far as the end of the preface, which by
the way, is one of the best portions of the book. O’Malley
then tells his own story. But the publishing office of the
“Dublin University Magazine” (in which the narrative
originally appeared) having been burned down, there
ensues a sad confusion of identity between O’Malley and
Lorrequer, so that it is difficult, for the nonce, to say which
is which. In the want of copy consequent upon the disaster,
James, the novelist, comes in to the relief of Lorrequer,
or perhaps of O’Malley, with one of the flattest and
most irrelevant of love-tales. Meantime, in the story
proper are repetitions without end. We have already said
that the hero <span class='it'>saves the life of his mistress twice, and of her
father twice</span>. But not content with this, he has <span class='it'>two</span> mistresses,
and <span class='it'>saves the life of both, at different periods, in
precisely the same manner</span>—that is to say, by causing his
horse, in each instance, to perform a Munchausen side-leap,
at the moment when a spring forward would have
impelled him upon his beloved. And then we have one
unending, undeviating succession of junketings, in which
“devilled kidneys” are never by any accident found wanting.
The unction and pertinacity with which the author
discusses what he chooses to denominate “devilled kidneys”
are indeed edifying, to say no more. The truth is,
that drinking wine, telling anecdotes, and devouring “devilled
kidneys” may be considered as the sum total, as the
<span class='it'>thesis</span> of the book. Never in the whole course of his eventful
life, does Mr. O’Malley get “two or three assembled
together” without seducing them forthwith to a table, and
placing before them a dozen of wine and a dish of “devilled
kidneys.” This accomplished, the parties begin
what seems to be the business of the author’s existence—the
narration of unusually <span class='it'>broad tales</span>—like those of the
Southdown mutton. And here, in fact, we have the <span class='it'>plan</span>
of that whole work of which the “United Service Gazette”
has been pleased to vow it “would rather be the author
than of all the ‘Pickwicks’ and ‘Nicklebys’ in the
world”—a sentiment which we really blush to say has
been echoed by many respectable members of our own
press. The general plot or narrative is a mere thread upon
which after-dinner anecdotes, some good, some bad, some
utterly worthless, and <span class='it'>not one truly original</span>, are strung
with about as much method, and about half as much dexterity,
as we see ragged urchins employ in stringing the
kernels of nuts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would, indeed, be difficult to convey to one who has
not examined this production for himself, any idea of the
exceedingly rough, clumsy, and inartistical manner in
which even this bald conception is carried out. The stories
are absolutely dragged in by the ears. So far from finding
them result naturally or plausibly from the conversation of
the interlocutors, even the blindest reader may perceive
the author’s struggling and blundering effort to introduce
them. It is rendered quite evident that they were originally
“on hand,” and that “O’Malley” has been concocted
for their introduction. Among other <span class='it'>niaïseries</span> we
observe the silly trick of whetting appetite by delay. The
conversation over the “kidneys” is brought, for example,
to such a pass that one of the speakers is called upon for a
story, which he forthwith declines for any reason, or for
none. At a subsequent “broil” he is again pressed, and
again refuses, and it is not until the reader’s patience is
fairly exhausted, and he has consigned both the story and
its author to Hades, that the gentleman in question is prevailed
upon to discourse. The only conceivable result of
this <span class='it'>fanfarronade</span> is the ruin of the tale when told, through
exaggerating anticipation respecting it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The anecdotes thus narrated being the staple of the
book, and the awkward manner of their interlocution
having been pointed out, it but remains to be seen what the
anecdotes are, in themselves, and what is the merit of
their narration. And here, let it not be supposed that we
have any design to deprive the devil of his due. There are
several very excellent anecdotes in “Charles O’Malley”
very cleverly and pungently told. Many of the scenes in
which Monsoon figures are rich—less, however, from the
scenes themselves than from the piquant, but by no means
original character of Monsoon—a drunken, maudlin, dishonest
old Major, given to communicativeness and mock
morality over his cups, and not over careful in detailing
adventures which tell against himself. One or two of the
college pictures are unquestionably good—but might have
been better. In general, the reader is made to feel that
fine subjects have fallen into unskilful hands. By way of
instancing this assertion, and at the same time of conveying
an idea of the tone and character of the stories, we will
quote one of the shortest, and assuredly one of the best.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, by-the-by, how’s the Major?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Charmingly: only a little bit in a scrape just now. Sir
Arthur—Lord Wellington, I mean—had him up for his
fellows being caught pillaging, and gave him a devil of a
rowing a few days ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Very disorderly corps yours, Major O’Shaughnessy,’
said the general; ‘more men up for punishment than any
regiment in the service.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shaugh muttered something, but his voice was lost in
a loud cock-a-doo-doo-doo, that some bold chanticleer set up
at the moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘If the officers do their duty Major O’Shaughnessy, these
acts of insubordination do not occur.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Cock-a-doo-doo-doo,’ was the reply. Some of the staff
found it hard not to laugh; but the general went on⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘If, therefore, the practice does not cease, I’ll draft the
men into West India regiments.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Cock-a-doo-doo-doo!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And if any articles pillaged from the inhabitants are
detected in the quarters, or about the persons of the
troops—’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Cock-a-doo-doo-<span class='it'>doo</span>!’ screamed louder here than
ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Damn that cock—where is it?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was a general look around on all sides, which
seemed in vain; when a tremendous repetition of the cry
resounded from O’Shaughnessy’s coat-pocket: thus detecting
the valiant Major himself in the very practice of his
corps. There was no standing this: every one burst out
into a peal of laughter; and Lord Wellington himself could
not resist, but turned away, muttering to himself as he
went—‘Damned robbers every man of them,’ while a final
war-note from the Major’s pocket closed the interview.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now this is an anecdote at which every one will laugh;
but its effect might have been vastly heightened by putting
a few words of grave morality and reprobation of the conduct
of his troops, into the mouth of O’Shaughnessy, upon
whose character they would have told well. The cock, in
interrupting the thread of his discourse, would thus have
afforded an excellent context. We have scarcely a reader,
moreover, who will fail to perceive the want of <span class='it'>tact</span> shown
in dwelling upon the <span class='it'>mirth</span> which the anecdote occasioned.
The error here is precisely like that of a man’s laughing at
his own spoken jokes. Our author is uniformly guilty of
this mistake. He has an absurd fashion, also, of informing
the reader, at the conclusion of each of his anecdotes, that,
however good the anecdote might be, he (the reader) cannot
enjoy it to the full extent in default of the <span class='it'>manner</span> in which
it was orally narrated. He has no business to say anything
of this kind. It is his duty to convey the manner not
less than the matter of his narratives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But we may say of these latter that, in general, they
have the air of being <span class='it'>remembered</span> rather than invented. No
man who has seen much of the rough life of the camp will
fail to recognize among them many very old acquaintances.
Some of them are as ancient as the hills, and have been,
time out of mind, the common property of the bivouac.
They have been narrated orally all the world over. The
chief merit of the writer is, that he has been the first to
collect and to print them. It is observable, in fact, that the
second volume of the work is very far inferior to the first.
The author seems to have exhausted his whole hoarded
store in the beginning. His conclusion is barren indeed,
and but for the historical details (for which he has no claim
to merit) would be especially prosy and dull. <span class='it'>Now the true
invention never exhausts itself.</span> It is mere cant and ignorance
to talk of the possibility of the really imaginative
man’s “writing himself out.” His soul but derives nourishment
from the streams that flow therefrom. As well
prate about the aridity of the eternal ocean
εξ ουπερ παντες ποταμοι.
So long as the universe of thought shall furnish
matter for novel combinations, so long will the spirit of true
genius be original, be exhaustless—be itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few cursory observations. The book is filled to over-flowing
with songs of very doubtful excellence, the most at
which are put into the mouth of one Micky Free, an amusing
Irish servant of O’Malley’s, and are given as his
impromptu effusions. The subject of the improvisos is
always the matter in hand at the moment of composition.
The author evidently prides himself upon his poetical
powers, about which the less we say the better; but if anything
were wanting to assure us of his absurd ignorance
and inappreciation of Art, we should find the fullest assurance
in the mode in which these doggrel verses are introduced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The occasional sentiment with which the volumes are
interspersed there is an absolute necessity for skipping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Can anybody tell us what is meant by the affectation of
the word <span class='it'>L’envoy</span> which is made the heading of two
prefaces?</p>

<p class='pindent'>That portion of the account of the battle of Waterloo
which gives O’Malley’s experiences while a prisoner, and
in close juxta-position to Napoleon, bears evident traces of
having been translated, and very literally too, from a
French manuscript.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The English of the work is sometimes even amusing. We
have continually, for example, <span class='it'>eat</span>, the present, for <span class='it'>ate</span>, the
perfect—see page 17. At page 16, we have this delightful
sentence—“Captain Hammersley, however, <span class='it'>never</span> took
further notice of me, but continued to recount, for the
amusement of those <span class='it'>about</span>, several excellent stories of his
military career, which I confess were heard with every
<span class='it'>test</span> of delight by all save me.” At page 357 we have some
sage talk about “the entire of the army;” and at page 368,
the accomplished O’Malley speaks of “<span class='it'>drawing</span> a last look
upon his sweetheart.” These things arrest our attention as
we open the book at random. It abounds in them, and in
vulgarisms even much worse than they.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But why speak of vulgarisms of language? There is a
disgusting vulgarism of thought which pervades and contaminates
this whole production, and from which a delicate
or lofty mind will shrink as from a pestilence. Not the
least repulsive manifestation of this leprosy is to be found
in the author’s blind and grovelling worship of mere rank.
Of the Prince Regent, that filthy compound of all that is
bestial—that lazar-house of all moral corruption—he scruples
not to speak in terms of the grossest adulation—sneering
at Edmund Burke in the same villainous breath in
which he extols the talents, the graces and <span class='it'>the virtues</span> of
George the Fourth! That any man, to-day, can be found
so degraded in heart as to style this reprobate, “one who,
in every feeling of his nature, and in every feature of his
deportment was every inch a prince”—is matter for grave
reflection and sorrowful debate. The American, at least,
who shall peruse the concluding pages of the book now
under review, and not turn in disgust from the base sycophancy
which infects them, is unworthy of his country and
his name. But the truth is, that a gross and contracted soul
renders itself unquestionably manifest in almost every line
of the composition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this—<span class='it'>this</span> is the <span class='it'>work</span>, in respect to which its author,
aping the airs of intellect, prates about his “haggard
cheek,” his “sunken eye,” his “aching and tired head,”
his “nights of toil” and (Good Heavens!) his “days of
<span class='it'>thought</span>!” That the thing is popular we grant—while that
we cannot deny the fact, we grieve. But the career of true
taste is onward—and now more vigorously onward than
ever—and the period, perhaps, is not hopelessly distant,
when, in decrying the mere balderdash of such matters as
“Charles O’Malley,” we shall do less violence to the feelings
and judgment even of the populace, than, we much
fear, has been done to-day.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Ballads and other Poems. By Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,
Author of “Voices of the Night,” “Hyperion,”
etc.: Second Edition. John Owen: Cambridge.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Il y a à parier</span>,” says Chamfort, “<span class='it'>que toute idée publique,
toute convention reçue, est une sottise, car elle a convenue
au plus grand nombre</span>.”—One would be safe in
wagering that any given public idea is erroneous, for it has
been yielded to the clamor of the majority;—and this strictly
philosophical, although somewhat French assertion has
especial bearing upon the whole race of what are termed
maxims and popular proverbs; nine-tenths of which are the
quintessence of folly. One of the most deplorably false of
them is the antique adage, <span class='it'>De gustibus non est disputandum</span>—there
should be no disputing about taste. Here the
idea designed to be conveyed is that any one person has as
just right to consider his own taste <span class='it'>the true</span>, as has any one
other—that taste itself, in short, is an arbitrary something,
amenable to no law, and measurable by no definite rules.
It must be confessed, however, that the exceedingly vague
and impotent treatises which are alone extant, have
much to answer for as regards confirming the general
error. Not the least important service which, hereafter,
mankind will owe to <span class='it'>Phrenology</span>, may perhaps, be recognised
in an analysis of the real principles, and a digest of
the resulting laws of taste. These principles, in fact, are
as clearly traceable, and these laws as readily susceptible
of system as are any whatever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime, the inane adage above mentioned is in
no respect more generally, more stupidly, and more pertinaciously
quoted than by the admirers of what is termed
the “good old Pope,” or the “good old Goldsmith school”
of poetry, in reference to the bolder, more natural, and
<span class='it'>more ideal</span> compositions of such authors as Coëtlogon and
Lamartine<a id='r5'/><a href='#f5' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[5]</span></sup></a> in France; Herder, Körner, and Uhland in
Germany; Brun and Baggesen in Denmark; Bellman,
Tegnér, and Nyberg<a id='r6'/><a href='#f6' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[6]</span></sup></a> in Sweden; Keats, Shelley, Coleridge,
and Tennyson in England; Lowell and Longfellow
in America. “<span class='it'>De gustibus non</span>,” say these “good-old-school”
fellows; and we have no doubt that their mental
translation of the phrase is—“We pity your taste—we pity
every body’s taste but our own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is our purpose, hereafter, when occasion shall be
afforded us, to controvert in an article of some length, the
popular idea that the poets just mentioned owe to novelty,
to trickeries of expression, and to other meretricious
effects, their appreciation by certain readers:—to demonstrate
(for the matter is susceptible of demonstration) that
such poetry and <span class='it'>such alone</span> has fulfilled the legitimate office
of the muse; has thoroughly satisfied an earnest and unquenchable
desire existing in the heart of man. In the
present number of our Magazine we have left ourselves
barely room to say a few random words of welcome to
these “Ballads,” by Longfellow, and to tender him, and
all such as he, the homage of our most earnest love and admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The volume before us (in whose outward appearance the
keen “taste” of genius is evinced with nearly as much precision
as in its internal soul) includes, with several brief
original pieces, a translation from the Swedish of Tegnér.
In attempting (what never should be attempted) a literal
version of both the words and the metre of this poem, Professor
Longfellow has failed to do justice either to his
author or himself. He has striven to do what no man ever
did well and what, from the nature of language itself,
never <span class='it'>can</span> be well done. Unless, for example, we shall
come to have an influx of <span class='it'>spondees</span> in our English tongue,
it will always be impossible to construct an English hexameter.
Our spondees, or, we should say, our spondaic
words, are rare. In the Swedish they are nearly as
abundant as in the Latin and Greek. We have only
“<span class='it'>compound</span>,” “<span class='it'>context</span>,” “<span class='it'>footfall</span>,” and a few other similar
ones. This is the difficulty; and that it <span class='it'>is</span> so will become
evident upon reading “The Children of the Lord’s
Supper,” where the sole <span class='it'>readable</span> verses are those in which
we meet with the rare spondaic dissyllables. We mean to
say <span class='it'>readable as Hexameters</span>; for many of them will read
very well as mere English Dactylics with certain irregularities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But within the narrow compass now left us we must not
indulge in anything like critical comment. Our readers
will be better satisfied perhaps with a few brief extracts
from the original poems of the volume—which we give for
their rare excellence, without pausing now to say in what
particulars this excellence exists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of these passages cannot be fully appreciated apart
from the context—but we address these who have read the
book. Of the translations we have not spoken. It is but
right to say, however, that “The Luck of Edenhall” is a
far finer poem, in every respect, than any of the original
pieces. Nor would we have our previous observations misunderstood.
Much as we admire the genius of Mr. Longfellow,
we are fully sensible of his many errors of affectation
and imitation. His artistical skill is great, and his ideality
high. But his conception of the <span class='it'>aims</span> of poesy <span class='it'>is all wrong</span>;
and this we shall prove at some future day—to our own
satisfaction, at least. His didactics are all <span class='it'>out of place</span>.
He has written brilliant poems—by accident; that is to say
when permitting his genius to get the better of his conventional
habit of thinking—a habit deduced from German
study. We do not mean to say that a didactic moral may
not be well made the <span class='it'>under-current</span> of a poetical thesis; but
that it can never be well put so obtrusively forth, as in the
majority of his compositions. There is a young American
who, with ideality not richer than that of Longfellow and
with less artistical knowledge, has yet composed far truer
poems, merely through the greater propriety of his themes.
We allude to James Russel Lowell; and in the number of
this Magazine for last month, will be found a ballad entitled
“Rosaline,” affording excellent exemplification of
our meaning. This composition has unquestionably its defects,
and the very defects which are never perceptible in
Mr. Longfellow—but we sincerely think that <span class='it'>no American
poem equals it</span> in the higher elements of song.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Critical and Miscellaneous Writings of Henry Lord
Brougham, to which is Prefixed a Sketch of his Character.
Two volumes. Lea and Blanchard.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That Lord Brougham <span class='it'>was</span> an extraordinary man no one
in his senses will deny. An intellect of unusual capacity,
goaded into diseased action by passions nearly ferocious,
enabled him to astonish the world, and especially the
“hero-worshippers,” as the author of Sartor-Resartus has
it, by the combined extent and variety of his mental
triumphs. Attempting many things, it may at least be said
that he egregiously failed in none. But that he pre-eminently
excelled in any cannot be affirmed with truth, and
might well be denied <span class='it'>à priori</span>. We have no faith in admirable
Crichtons, and this merely because we have implicit
faith in Nature and her laws. “He that is born to
be a man,” says Wieland, in his ‘Peregrinus Proteus,’
“neither should nor can be anything nobler, greater, nor
better than a man.” The Broughams of the human intellect
are never its Newtons or its Bayles. Yet the contemporaneous
reputation to be acquired by the former is naturally
greater than any which the latter may attain. The
versatility of one whom we see and hear is a more dazzling
and more readily appreciable merit than his profundity;
which latter is best estimated in the silence of the closet,
and after the quiet lapse of years. What impression Lord
Brougham has stamped upon his age, cannot be accurately
determined until Time has fixed and rendered definite the
lines of the medal; and fifty years hence it will be difficult,
perhaps, even to make out the deepest indentations of the
<span class='it'>exergue</span>. Like Coleridge he should be regarded as one who
might have done much, had he been satisfied with attempting
but little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The title of the book before us is, we think, somewhat
disingenuous. These two volumes contain but a small portion
of the “Critical and Miscellaneous Writings” of Lord
Brougham; and the preface itself assures us that what is
here published <span class='it'>forms only a part of his anonymous contributions
to the Edinburgh Review</span>. In fact three similar
selections from his “Miscellaneous Works” have been
given to the world within a year or two past, by Philadelphian
publishers, and neither of these selections embrace
any of the matter now issued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The present volumes, however, are not the less valuable
on this account. They contain many of the most noted and
some of the best compositions of the author. Among other
articles of interest we have the celebrated “Discourse on
the Objects, Pleasures and Advantages of Science”—a
title, by the way, in which the word “pleasures” is one
of the purest supererogation. That this discourse is well
written, we, of course, admit, since we do not wish to be
denounced as blockheads; but we beg leave to disagree,
most positively, with the Preface, which asserts that
“there was only one individual living by whom it could
have been produced.” This round asseveration will only
excite a smile upon the lips of every man of the slightest
pretension to scientific acquirement. We are personally
acquainted with at least a dozen individuals who could
have written this treatise <span class='it'>as well</span> as the Lord Chancellor
has written it. In fact, a discourse of this character is by
no means difficult of composition—a discourse such as
Lord Brougham has given us. His whole design consists
in an unmethodical collection of the most <span class='it'>striking</span> and at
the same time the most <span class='it'>popularly comprehensible facts</span> in
general science. And it cannot be denied that this plan of
demonstrating the advantages of science as a whole <span class='it'>by detailing
insulated specimens of its interest</span> is a most unphilosophical
and inartistical mode of procedure—a mode which
even puts one in mind of the σκολαστικος offering a brick
as a sample of the house he wished to sell. Neither is the
essay free (as should be imperatively demanded in a case
of this nature) from very gross error and mis-statement. Its
style, too, in its minor points, is unusually bad. The
strangest grammatical errors abound, of which the initial
pages are especially full, and the whole is singularly deficient
in that precision which should characterise a scientific
discourse. In short, it is an entertaining essay, but in
some degree superficial and quackish, and could have been
<span class='it'>better</span> written by any one of a multitude of living <span class='it'>savans</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is a very amusing paper, in this collection, upon
the authorship of Junius. We allude to it, now especially,
by way of corroborating what we said, in our January
number, touching the ordinary character of the English
review-system. The article was furnished the Edinburgh
Quarterly by its author, who, no doubt, received for it a
very liberal compensation. It is, nevertheless, one of the
most barefaced impositions we ever beheld; being nothing
in the world more than a tame <span class='it'>compendium</span>, fact by fact, of
the book under discussion—“The Identity of Junius with a
Distinguished Living Character Established.” There is no
attempt at analysis—no new fact is adduced—no novel
argument is urged—and yet the thing is called a criticism
and liberally paid for as such. The secret of this style of
Review-making is that of mystifying the reader by an artful
substitution of the interest appertaining to the text for
interest aroused by the commentator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The title of this work explains its nature with accuracy.
To human knowledge in general, it is what a map of the
world is to geography. The design is chiefly, <span class='it'>to classify</span>,
and thus present a dependent and clearly discernible whole.
To those who have paid much attention to Natural History
and the endless, unstable, and consequently vexatious classifications
which there occur—to those, in especial, who
have labored over the “Conchologies” of De Blainville and
Lamarck, some faint—some very faint idea of the difficulties
attending such a labor as this, will occur. There have
been numerous prior attempts of the same kind, and although
this is unquestionably <span class='it'>one</span> of the best, we cannot regard
it as the best. Mr. Park has chosen a highly artificial
scheme of arrangement; and both reason and experience
show us that <span class='it'>natural</span> classifications, or those which proceed
upon broad and immediately recognisable distinctions, are
alone practically or permanently successful. We say this,
however, with much deference to the opinions of a gentleman,
whose means of acquiring <span class='it'>knowledge</span>, have been
equalled only by his zeal in its pursuit, and whose general
talents we have had some personal opportunity of estimating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We mean nothing like criticism in so brief a paragraph
as we can here afford, upon a work so voluminous and so
important as the one before us. Our design is merely to
call the attention of our friends to the publication—whose
merits are obvious and great. Its defects are, of course,
numerous. We mean rather to say, that in every work of
this nature, it is in the power of almost every reader to
suggest a thousand emendations. We might object to many
of the details. We <span class='it'>must</span> object to nearly all of the belles-lettres
portion of the book. We cannot stand being told, for
example, that “Barlow’s ‘Columbiad’ is a poem of considerable
merit;” nor are we rendered more patient under
the infliction of this and similar opinions, by the information
that Vander Vondel and Vander Doos (the deuce!)
wrote capital Dutch epics, while “the poems of Cats are
said to be spirited and <span class='it'>pious</span>!” We know nothing about
cats, nor cats about piety.</p>

curious and worthy of investigation—first, on account of
the jealousy with which the students have hitherto withheld
all information on the subject, and secondly, on account
of the deep root which the customs themselves have
taken in the heart of the German life. The Burschendom,
of which we have all heard so much, yet so vaguely, is no
modern or evanescent eccentricity; but a matter of firm

<p class='pindent'>Professor Smyth’s system of history is remarkable, if
not peculiar. He selects certain periods, and groups around
them individually those events to which they have closest
affinity not only in time, but character. The effect is surprising
through its force and perspicuity. The name of
Professor Sparks would be alone sufficient to recommend
these volumes—but in themselves they are a treasure.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>First Book of Natural History, Prepared for the Use of
Schools and Colleges. By W. S. W. Ruschenberger, M. D.,
Surgeon in the U. S. Navy, &amp;c. &amp;c. From the Text of
Milne Edwards &amp; Achille Comte, Professors of Natural
History in the Colleges of Henri IV. and Charlemagne.
With Plates. Turner &amp; Fisher: Philadelphia.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This little book forms, in the original, the first of a series
of First or Elementary works on Natural History, arranged
by Messieurs Edwards and Comte, two gentlemen distinguished
for labors of the kind, and who enjoy the patronage
of the “Royal Council of Public Instruction of France.”
The translator is well known to the reading world, and
there can be no doubt of the value of the publication in its
present form.</p>

to the Treatment of Stammering, and Defective Articulation,
Comprising Numerous Diagrams and Engraved
Figures, Illustrative of the Subject. By Andrew Comstock,
M. D. Published by the Author: Philadelphia.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is, in many respects, an excellent book, although the
principal claim of Dr. Comstock is that of having cleverly
compiled. His method of representing, or notating, the modulations
of the speaking voice, is original, as he himself
states, but there is little else which can be called so. Originality,
however, is not what we seek in a school-book,
and this has the merit of tasteful selection and precision of
style.</p>

Sketches from Life. By Isabella F. Romer. Two Volumes.
Lea &amp; Blanchard: Philadelphia.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This work is republished, we presume, not so much on
account of its intrinsic merit, as on account of the present
<span class='it'>émeute</span> in our immediate vicinity and elsewhere, on the
subject of Animal Magnetism. “Sturmer,” the principal
story, is, nevertheless, well narrated and will do much in
the way of helping unbelief. The minor tales are even
beautiful. “The Mother and Daughter” is exceedingly
pathetic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Hawthorne has received high praise from men whose
opinions we have been accustomed to respect. Hereafter
we shall endeavor to speak of his tales with that deliberation
which is their due. The one now before us is a
simple and pretty story.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We like Mr. James far better as the historian or biographer
than as the novelist. The truth is, it is sheer waste of
time to read second-rate fictions by men of merely imitative
talent, when at the same expense of money and labor
we can indulge in the never-failing stream of invention now
poured forth by true genius.</p>

Mr. Cooper, against whom they are especially levelled;
but we like neither this design of personal ridicule nor the
manner in which it is effected.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The publisher, in his preface, states that three editions of
this work, comprising eight thousand copies, have been
sold; and of this we are pleased to hear; but we are not
equally pleased with the information (conveyed also in the
preface) that a <span class='it'>new</span> set of illustrations is given. If these
“illustrations” are <span class='it'>new</span>, then “new” has come to be employed
in the sense of “old.” The plates are not only
antique but trashy in other respects. Of the poems themselves
we have no space to speak fully this month. Some
of them are excellent; and there are many which merit
no commendation. Mrs. Sigourney deserves much, but by no
means all of the applause which her compositions have
elicited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would be easy to cite, from the volume now before us,
numerous brief passages of the truest beauty; but we fear
that it would be more difficult to point out an entire poem
which would bear examination, <span class='it'>as a whole</span>. In the piece
entitled “Indian Names,” there are thoughts and <span class='it'>expression</span>
which would do honor to any one. We note, also, an unusually
noble idea in the “Death of an Infant.”</p>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
